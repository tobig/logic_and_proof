<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="first_order_logic.html#first-order-logic"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 7</span></a> we discussed the notion of a <em>relation symbol</em> in first-order logic, and in <a class="reference internal" href="semantics_of_first_order_logic.html#semantics-of-first-order-logic"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 10</span></a> we saw how to interpret such a symbol in a model. In mathematics, we are generally interested in different sorts of relationships between mathematical objects, and so the notion of a relation is ubiquitous. In this chapter, we will consider some common kinds of relations.</p>
<p>In some axiomatic foundations, the notion of a relation is taken to be primitive, but in axiomatic set theory, a relation is taken to be a set of tuples of the corresponding arity. For example, we can take a binary relation on <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to be a subset of <span class="math">\(A \times A\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(R(a, b)\)</span> means that <span class="math">\((a, b) \in R\)</span>. The foundational definition is generally irrelevant to everyday mathematical practice; what is important is simply that we can write expressions like <span class="math">\(R(a, b)\)</span>, and that they are true or false, depending on the values of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. In mathematics, we often use <em>infix</em> notation, writing <span class="math">\(a R b\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\(R(a, b)\)</span>.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2>13.1. Order Relations<a class="headerlink" href="#order-relations" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>We will start with a class of important binary relations in mathematics, namely, <em>partial orders</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A binary relation <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a <em>partial order</em> if it has the following three properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>reflexivity</em>: <span class="math">\(a \leq a\)</span>, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
<li><em>transitivity</em>: if <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \leq c\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(a \leq c\)</span>, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
<li><em>antisymmetry</em>: if <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \leq a\)</span> then <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Notice the compact way of introducing the symbol <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> in the statement of the definition, and the fact that <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is written as an infix symbol. Notice also that even though the relation is written with the symbol <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>, it is the only symbol occurring in the definition; mathematical practice favors natural language to describe its properties.</p>
<p>You now know enough, however, to recognize the universal quantifiers that are present in the three clauses. In symbolic logic, we would write them as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\forall a \; (a \leq a)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall a, b, c \; (a \leq b \wedge b \leq c \to a \leq c)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall a, b \; (a \leq b \wedge b \leq a \to a = b)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Here the variables <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> implicitly range over the domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>The use of the symbol <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is meant to be suggestive, and, indeed, the following are all examples of partial orders:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on the natural numbers</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on the integers</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on the rational numbers</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on the real numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>But keep in mind that <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is only a symbol; it can have unexpected interpretations as well. For example, all of the following are also partial orders:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\geq\)</span> on the natural numbers</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\geq\)</span> on the integers</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\geq\)</span> on the rational numbers</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\geq\)</span> on the real numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not fully representative of the class of partial orders, in that they all have an additional property:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A partial order <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a <em>total order</em> (also called a <em>linear order</em>) if it also has the following property:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, either <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(b \leq a\)</span></li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>You can check these these are two examples of partial orders that are not total orders:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the divides relation, <span class="math">\(x \mid y\)</span>, on the integers</li>
<li>the subset relation, <span class="math">\(x \subseteq y\)</span>, on sets of elements of some domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On the integers, we also have the strict order relation, <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span>, which is not a partial order, since it is not reflexive. It is, rather, an instance of a <em>strict partial order</em>:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A binary relation <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a <em>strict partial order</em> if it satisfies the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>irreflexivity</em>: <span class="math">\(a \nless a\)</span> for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
<li><em>transitivity</em>: <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b &lt; c\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(a &lt; c\)</span>, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A strict partial order is a <em>strict total order</em> (or <em>strict linear order</em>) if, in addition, we have the following property:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>trichotomy</em>: <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(a &gt; b\)</span> for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(b \nless a\)</span> means, of course, that it is not the case that <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(a &gt; b\)</span> is alternative notation for <span class="math">\(b &lt; a\)</span>. To distinguish an ordinary partial order from a strict one, an ordinary partial order is sometimes called a <em>weak</em> partial order.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>. A strict partial order <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> on <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is <em>asymmetric</em>: for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(b \nless a\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Suppose <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b &lt; a\)</span>. Then, by transitivity, <span class="math">\(a &lt; a\)</span>, contradicting irreflexivity.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>On the integers, there are precise relationships between <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>: <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span> or <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x \neq y\)</span>. This illustrates a more general phenomenon.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is a partial order on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Define <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> to mean that <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a \neq b\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> is a strict partial order. Moreover, if <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is total, so is <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> is a strict partial order on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Define <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> to mean <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is a partial order. Moreover, if <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> is total, so is <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We will prove the first here, and leave the second as an exercise. This proof is a nice illustration of how universal quantification, equality, and propositional reasoning are combined in a mathematical argument.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Suppose <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is a partial order on <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> be defined as in the statement of the theorem. Irreflexivity is immediate, since <span class="math">\(a &lt; a\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(a \neq a\)</span>, which is a contradiction.</p>
<p>To show transitivity, suppose <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b &lt; c\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b \leq c\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a \neq b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(b \neq c\)</span>. By the transitivity of <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(a \leq c\)</span>. To show <span class="math">\(a &lt; c\)</span>, we only have to show <span class="math">\(a \neq c\)</span>. So suppose <span class="math">\(a = c\)</span>. then, from the hypotheses, we have <span class="math">\(c &lt; b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b &lt; c\)</span>, violating asymmetry. So <span class="math">\(a \neq c\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>To establish the last claim in the theorem, suppose <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is total, and let <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> be any elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. We need to show that <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(a &gt; b\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>, we are done, so we can assume <span class="math">\(a \neq b\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is total, we have <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(a \neq b\)</span>, in the first case we have <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span>, and in the second case, we have <span class="math">\(a &gt; b\)</span>.</p>

<h2>13.2. More on Orderings<a class="headerlink" href="#more-on-orderings" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> be a partial order on a domain, <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and let <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> be the associated strict order, as defined in the last section. It is possible to show that if we go in the other direction, and define <span class="math">\(\leq'\)</span> to be the partial order associated to <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\leq'\)</span> are the same, which is to say, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(a \leq' b\)</span>. So we can think of every partial order as really being a pair, consisting of a weak partial order and an associated strict one. In other words, we can assume that <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span> holds if and only if <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x \neq y\)</span>, and we can assume <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> holds if and only if <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span> or <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will henceforth adopt this convention. Given a partial order <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> and the associated strict order <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span>, we leave it to you to show that if <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y &lt; z\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x &lt; z\)</span>, and, similarly, if <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y \leq z\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x &lt; z\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the natural numbers with the less-than-or-equal relation. It has a least element, <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. We can express the fact that <span class="math">\(0\)</span> is the least element in at least two ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(0\)</span> is less than or equal to every natural number.</li>
<li>There is no natural number that is less than <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In symbolic logic, we could formalize these statements as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (0 \leq x)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \nless 0)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the existential quantifier, we could render the second statement more faithfully as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\neg \exists x \; (x &lt; 0)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that this more faithful statement is equivalent to the original, using deMorgan&#8217;s laws for quantifiers.</p>
<p>Are the two statements above equivalent? Say an element <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is <em>minimum</em> for a partial order if it is less than or equal to any other element, that is, if it takes the place of 0 in the first statement. Say that an element <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is <em>minimal</em> for a partial order if no element is less than it, that is, if it takes the place of 0 in the second statement. Two facts are immediate.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Any minimum element is minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is minimum for <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>. We need to show that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is minimal, that is, for every <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, it is not the case that <span class="math">\(y &lt; x\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math">\(y &lt; x\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is minimum, we have <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span>. From <span class="math">\(y &lt; x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(y &lt; y\)</span>, contradicting the irreflexivity of <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If a partial order <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> has a minimum element, it is unique.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span> are both minimum. Then <span class="math">\(x_1 \leq x_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2 \leq x_1\)</span>. By antisymmetry, <span class="math">\(x_1 = x_2\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Notice that we have interpreted the second theorem as the statement that if <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span> are both minimum, then <span class="math">\(x_1 = x_2\)</span>. Indeed, this is exactly what we mean when we say that something is &#8220;unique.&#8221; When a partial order has a minimum element <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, uniqueness is what justifies calling <span class="math">\(x\)</span> <em>the</em> minimum element. Such an <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is also called the <em>least</em> element or the <em>smallest</em> element, and the terms are generally interchangeable.</p>
<p>The converse to the second theorem &#8211; that is, the statement that every minimal element is minimum &#8211; is false. As an example, consider the nonempty subsets of the set <span class="math">\(\{ 1, 2 \}\)</span> with the subset relation. In other words, consider the collection of sets <span class="math">\(\{ 1 \}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\{ 2 \}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\{1, 2\}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\{ 1 \} \subseteq \{1, 2\}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\{ 2 \} \subseteq \{1, 2\}\)</span>, and, of course, every element is a subset of itself. Then you can check that <span class="math">\(\{1\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\{2\}\)</span> are each minimal, but neither is minimum. (One can also exhibit such a partial order by drawing a diagram, with dots labeled <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, etc., and upwards edges between elements to indicate that one is less than or equal to the other.)</p>
<p>Notice that the statement &#8220;a minimal element of a partial order is not necessarily minimum&#8221; makes an &#8220;existential&#8221; assertion: it says that there is a partial order <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>, and an element <span class="math">\(x\)</span> of the domain, such that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is minimal but not minimum. For a fixed partial order <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>, we can express the assertion that such an <span class="math">\(x\)</span> exists as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\exists x \; (\forall y \; (y \nless x) \wedge \forall y \; (x \leq y)).\]</div>
<p>The assertion that there exists a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and a partial order <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on that domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, is more dramatic: it is a &#8220;higher order&#8221; existential assertion. But symbolic logic provides us with the means to make assertions like these as well, as we will see later on.</p>
<p>We can consider other properties of orders. An order is said to be <em>dense</em> if between any two distinct elements, there is another element. More precisely, an order is dense if, whenever <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span>, there is an element <span class="math">\(z\)</span> satisfying <span class="math">\(x &lt; z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z &lt; y\)</span>. For example, the rational numbers are dense with the usual <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> ordering, but not the integers. Saying that an order is dense is another example of an implicit use of existential quantification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equivalence-relations-and-equality">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>13.3. Equivalence Relations and Equality<a class="headerlink" href="#equivalence-relations-and-equality" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>In ordinary mathematical language, an <em>equivalence relation</em> is defined as follows.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition</strong>. A binary relation <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> on some domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is said to be an <em>equivalence relation</em> if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. In other words, <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> is an equivalent relation if it satisfies these three properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>reflexivity</em>: <span class="math">\(a \equiv a\)</span>, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
<li><em>symmetry</em>: if <span class="math">\(a \equiv b\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(b \equiv a\)</span>, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
<li><em>transitivity</em>: if <span class="math">\(a \equiv b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \equiv c\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(a \equiv c\)</span>, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span></li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We leave it to you to think about how you could write these statements in first-order logic. (Note the similarity to the rules for a partial order.) We will also leave you with an exercise: by a careful choice of how to instantiate the quantifiers, you can actually prove the three properties above from the following two:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\forall a \; (a \equiv a)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall {a, b, c} \; (a \equiv b \wedge c \equiv b \to a \equiv c)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Try to verify this using natural deduction or Lean.</p>
<p>These three properties alone are not strong enough to characterize equality. You should check that the following informal examples are all instances of equivalence relations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the relation on days on the calendar, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> fall on the same day of the week&#8221;</li>
<li>the relation on people currently alive on the planet, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> have the same age&#8221;</li>
<li>the relation on people currently alive on the planet, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> have the same birthday&#8221;</li>
<li>the relation on cities in the United States, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are in the same state&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are two common mathematical examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the relation on lines in a plane, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are parallel&#8221;</li>
<li>for any fixed natural number <span class="math">\(m \geq 0\)</span>, the relation on natural numbers, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> is congruent to <span class="math">\(y\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(m\)</span>&#8221; (see <a class="reference internal" href="elementary_number_theory.html#elementary-number-theory"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 19</span></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we say that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is congruent to <span class="math">\(y\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(m\)</span> if they leave the same remainder when divided by <span class="math">\(m\)</span>. Soon, you will be able to prove rigorously that this is equivalent to saying that <span class="math">\(x - y\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the equivalence relation on citizens of the United States, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> have the same age.&#8221; There are some properties that respect that equivalence. For example, suppose I tell you that John and Susan have the same age, and I also tell you that John is old enough to vote. Then you can rightly infer that Susan is old enough to vote. On the other hand, if I tell you nothing more than the facts that John and Susan have the same age and John lives in South Dakota, you cannot infer that Susan lives in South Dakota. This little example illustrates what is special about the <em>equality</em> relation: if two things are equal, then they have exactly the same properties.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> be a set and let <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> be an equivalence relation on <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. There is an important mathematical construction known as forming the <em>quotient</em> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> under the equivalence relation. For every element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, let <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> be the set of elements <span class="math">\(\{ c \mid c \equiv a \}\)</span>, that is, the set of elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> that are equivalent to <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. We call <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> the equivalence class of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. The set <span class="math">\(A / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span>, the <em>quotient of</em> <span class="math">\(A\)</span> <em>by</em> <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span>, is defined to be the set <span class="math">\(\{ [a] : a \in A \}\)</span>, that is, the set of all the equivalence classes of elements in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. The exercises below as you to show that if <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> and <span class="math">\([b]\)</span> are elements of such a quotient, then <span class="math">\([a] = [b]\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(a \equiv b\)</span>.</p>
<p>The motivation is as follows. Equivalence tries to capture a weak notion of equality: if two elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> are equivalent, they are not necessarily the same, but they are similar in some way. Equivalence classes collect similar objects together, essentially glomming them into new objects.  Thus <span class="math">\(A / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span> is a version of the set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> where similar elements have been compressed into a single element. For example, given the equivalence relation <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> of congruence modulo 5 on the integers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span> is the set <span class="math">\(\{ [0], [1], [2], [3], [4] \}\)</span>, where, for example, <span class="math">\([0]\)</span> is the set of all multiples of 5.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Suppose <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> is a strict partial order on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and define <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> to mean that <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Show that <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is a partial order.</li>
<li>Show that if <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> is moreover a strict total order, then <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is a total order.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Above we proved the analogous theorem going in the other direction.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Suppose <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> is a strict partial order on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. (In other words, it is transitive and asymmetric.) Suppose that <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is defined so that <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>. We saw in class that <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is a partial order on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, i.e.~it is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric.</p>
<p>Prove that for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(a &lt; b\)</span> iff <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a \neq b\)</span>, using the facts above.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An <em>ordered graph</em> is a collection of vertices (points), along with a collection of arrows between vertices. For each pair of vertices, there is at most one arrow between them: in other words, every pair of vertices is either unconnected, or one vertex is &#8220;directed&#8221; toward the other. Note that it is possible to have an arrow from a vertex to itself.</p>
<p>Define a relation <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on the set of vertices, such that for two vertices <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span> means that there is an arrow from <span class="math">\(a\)</span> pointing to <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>On an arbitrary graph, is <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> a partial order, a strict partial order, a total order, a strict total order, or none of the above? If possible, give examples of graphs where <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> fails to have these properties.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Let <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> be an equivalence relation on a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. For every element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, let <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> be the equivalence class of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>: that is, the set of elements <span class="math">\(\{ c \mid c \equiv a \}\)</span>. Show that for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\([a] = [b]\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(a \equiv b\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Hints and notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remember that since you are proving an ``if and only if&#8217;&#8217; statement, there are two directions to prove.</li>
<li>Since that <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> and <span class="math">\([b]\)</span> are sets, <span class="math">\([a] = [b]\)</span> means that for every element <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is in <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is in <span class="math">\([b]\)</span>.</li>
<li>By definition, an element <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is in <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(c \equiv a\)</span>. In particular, <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is in <span class="math">\([a]\)</span>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Let the relation <span class="math">\(\sim\)</span> on the natural numbers <span class="math">\(\mathbb{B}\)</span> be defined as follows: if <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is even, then <span class="math">\(n \sim n+1\)</span>, and if <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is odd, then <span class="math">\(n \sim n-1\)</span>. Furthermore, for every <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n \sim n\)</span>. Show that <span class="math">\(\sim\)</span> is an equivalence relation. What is the equivalence class of the number 5? Describe the set of equivalence classes <span class="math">\(\{ [n] \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Show that the relation on lines in the plane, given by &#8220;<span class="math">\(l_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(l_2\)</span> are parallel,&#8221; is an equivalence relation. What is the equivalence class of the x-axis? Describe the set of equivalence classes <span class="math">\(\{ [l] \mid l\text{ is a line in the plane} \}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A binary relation <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is said to be a <em>preorder</em> it is is reflexive and transitive. This is weaker than saying it is a partial order; we have removed the requirement that the relation is asymmetric. An example is the ordering on people currently alive on the planet defined by setting <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> &#8216;s birth date is earlier than <span class="math">\(y\)</span> &#8216;s. Asymmetry fails, because different people can be born on the same day. But, prove that the following theorem holds:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> be a preorder on a domain <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Define the relation <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(x \equiv y\)</span> holds if and only if <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y \leq x\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> is an equivalence relation on <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
