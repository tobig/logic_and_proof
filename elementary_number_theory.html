<p>In the last two chapters, we saw that the natural numbers are characterized by the fact that they support <em>proof by induction</em> and <em>definition by recursion</em>. Moreover, with these components, we can actually define <span class="math">\(+\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\times\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span> in a suitable axiomatic foundation, and prove that they have the relevant properties. In <a class="reference internal" href="the_natural_numbers_and_induction.html#the-integers"><span class="std std-numref">Section 17.6</span></a> we also discussed the integers, which include negative numbers and support the operation of subtraction.</p>
<p>The natural numbers and the integers are the central components of <em>number theory</em>, a branch of mathematics dating back to the ancients. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the rudiments of this subject.</p>

<h2>19.1. The Quotient-Remainder Theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-quotient-remainder-theorem" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>A key property of the integers that we will use here is the quotient-remainder theorem:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> be integers with <span class="math">\(m &gt; 0\)</span>. Then there are integers <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> satisfying <span class="math">\(n = m q + r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0 \le r &lt; m\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> First we prove this in the case where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is a natural number, in which case use complete induction on <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> be any natural number. If <span class="math">\(n &lt; m\)</span>, then we can take <span class="math">\(q = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r = n\)</span>, and we indeed have <span class="math">\(n = m q + r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0 \le r &lt; m\)</span>. Otherwise, we have <span class="math">\(n \geq m\)</span>. In this case <span class="math">\(n - m\)</span> is a natural number smaller than <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. By induction hypothesis, we know that we can find <span class="math">\(q'\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r'\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(n - m = m q' + r'\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0 \le r' &lt; m\)</span>. Then we can choose <span class="math">\(q = q' + 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r = r'\)</span>, and we obtain <span class="math">\(n = m q + r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0 \le r &lt; m\)</span>, as desired.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is negative, then <span class="math">\(-(n+1)\)</span> is a natural number, hence we can use the previous part for <span class="math">\(-(n+1)\)</span> to obtain <span class="math">\(q'\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r'\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(-(n+1) = m q' + r'\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0 \le r' &lt; m\)</span>. Now let <span class="math">\(q = -(q' + 1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r = m - r' - 1\)</span>. Then we can compute</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}m q + r &amp;= -m (q' + 1) + m - r' - 1\\
&amp;=  -(m q' + r') - m + m - 1\\
&amp;= -(-(n+1)) - 1\\
&amp;= n + 1 - 1\\
&amp;= n.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Also, since <span class="math">\(r' \geq 0\)</span> we have <span class="math">\(r &lt; m\)</span> and since <span class="math">\(r' &lt; m\)</span> we have <span class="math">\(r \geq 0\)</span>. This completes the proof.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Intuitively, <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the integer <em>quotient</em> when you divide <span class="math">\(n\)</span> by <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the <em>remainder</em>. Remember that using the word &#8220;the&#8221; presupposes that there are unique values meeting that description. That is, in fact, the case:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> are as above, <span class="math">\(n = m q + r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n = m q' + r'\)</span> with both <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r'\)</span> less than <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(q = q'\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r = r'\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> By assumption, we have <span class="math">\(mq + r = m q' + r'\)</span>. It suffices to show that <span class="math">\(q = q'\)</span>, because then <span class="math">\(m q = m q'\)</span>, and hence <span class="math">\(r = r'\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(q \ne q'\)</span>. Then either <span class="math">\(q &lt; q'\)</span> or <span class="math">\(q' &lt; q\)</span>. Suppose without loss of generality that <span class="math">\(q &lt; q'\)</span>. (The other case is symmetric.) Then <span class="math">\(m q &lt; m q'\)</span>, so we can subtract <span class="math">\(mq\)</span> from both sides of the equality <span class="math">\(mq + r = m q' + r'\)</span> to obtain</p>
<div class="math">
\[r = m q' + r' - m q = m (q - q') + r'.\]</div>
<p>But since <span class="math">\(q' &lt; q\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(q - q' \ge 1\)</span>, which means</p>
<div class="math">
\[m (q - q') + r' \ge m + r' \ge m,\]</div>
<p>which contradicts the fact that <span class="math">\(r &lt; m\)</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="divisibility">
<h2>19.2. Divisibility<a class="headerlink" href="#divisibility" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>We can define divisibility on the integers as follows.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Given two integers <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, we say that <span class="math">\(m\)</span> <em>is a divisor of</em> <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, written <span class="math">\(m \mid n\)</span>, if there exists some integer <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(m \cdot k = n\)</span>. We also say that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> <em>is divisible by</em> <span class="math">\(m\)</span> or that <span class="math">\(m\)</span> <em>divides</em> <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. We write <span class="math">\(m \nmid n\)</span> to say that <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is not a divisor of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We can now prove the following:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The relation <span class="math">\(\mid\)</span> is reflexive and transitive. Also, if <span class="math">\(n \mid m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m \mid n\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(m = \pm n\)</span>. This means that restricted to the natural numbers, this relation is a partial order.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Reflexivity is immediate, because <span class="math">\(n \cdot 1 = n\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(n\mid n\)</span>.</p>
<p>For transitivity, suppose <span class="math">\(m \mid n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n \mid r\)</span>. Then there are <span class="math">\(k,\ell\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(m \cdot k = n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n \cdot \ell = r\)</span>. Now we compute</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}m \cdot (k \cdot \ell) &amp;= (m \cdot k) \cdot \ell \\
&amp; = n \cdot \ell  \\
&amp; = r.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> are integers such that <span class="math">\(n\mid m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m \mid n\)</span>. Then there exist <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ell\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(n\cdot k = m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m \cdot \ell = n\)</span>. We distinguish two cases. If <span class="math">\(n = 0\)</span>, then we have <span class="math">\(m = n\cdot k = 0 = n\)</span>, so we are done. If <span class="math">\(n \neq 0\)</span>, then we use the the equations to get <span class="math">\(n \cdot k \cdot \ell = m \cdot \ell = n\)</span>, and we can cancel <span class="math">\(n\)</span> on both sides to get <span class="math">\(k \cdot \ell = 1\)</span>. We conclude that <span class="math">\(k = \ell = \pm 1\)</span>, hence we get <span class="math">\(m = n \cdot k = \pm n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that this means that if <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> are both natural numbers, then <span class="math">\(n = m\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(\mid\)</span> is antisymmetric, and hence a partial order, on the natural numbers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>See Exercise 1 for some basic properties of divisibility.</p>
<p>An integer is <em>even</em> if it is divisible by <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, in other words, <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is even if <span class="math">\(2 \mid n\)</span>. An integer is <em>odd</em> if it is not even. Of course, odd numbers are of the form <span class="math">\(2k+1\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and we can prove this now.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is an odd integer, then <span class="math">\(n=2k+1\)</span> for some integer <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> By the quotient-remainder theorem, we can write <span class="math">\(n = 2k+r\)</span> for some integers <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> with <span class="math">\(0\le r &lt; 2\)</span>. The last condition means that <span class="math">\(r = 0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(r = 1\)</span>. In the first case, we have <span class="math">\(n = 2k\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(2 \mid n\)</span>, contradicting that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is odd. So we have <span class="math">\(r = 1\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(n = 2k+1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Every sequence of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> consecutive numbers contains a number divisible by <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Denote the largest element of the sequence by <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. This means that the sequence is <span class="math">\(n - (k - 1), \ldots, n - 1, n\)</span>. By the quotient-remainder theorem, we have <span class="math">\(n = q k + r\)</span> for some integers <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> with <span class="math">\(0\leq r &lt; k\)</span>. From these inequalities we conclude that <span class="math">\(n - r\)</span> is in our sequence, and <span class="math">\(n - r = q k\)</span>, hence divisible by <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Given two integers <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> such that either <span class="math">\(m \neq 0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(n \neq 0\)</span>, we define the <em>greatest common divisor</em> <span class="math">\(\gcd(m,n)\)</span> of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> to be the largest integer <span class="math">\(d\)</span> which is both a divisor of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, that is <span class="math">\(d \mid m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d \mid n\)</span>.</p>
<p>This largest integer exists, because there is at least one common divisor, but only finitely many. There is at least one, since 1 is a common divisor of any two integers, and there are finitely many, since a nonzero number has only finitely many divisors.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(n = m = 0\)</span>, then we define <span class="math">\(\gcd(0,0) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The greatest common divisor of two numbers is always a natural number, since 1 is always a common divisor of two numbers. As an example, let us compute the greatest common divisor of 6 and 28. The positive divisors of 6 are <span class="math">\(\{1, 2, 3, 6\}\)</span> and the positive divisors of 28 are <span class="math">\(\{1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\}\)</span>. The largest number in both these sets is 2, which is the greatest common divisor of 6 and 28.</p>
<p>However, computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers by listing all the divisors of both numbers is a lot of work, so we will now consider a method to compute the greatest common divisor more efficiently.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> For all integers <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> we have <span class="math">\(\gcd(n,m)=\gcd(m,n-km)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(d = \gcd(n,m)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r = n-km\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(n = m = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(d = 0 = \gcd(m,r)\)</span>, and we&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>In the other case we first show that the set of common divisors of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is the same as the set of the common divisors of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. To see this, let <span class="math">\(d' \mid m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d' \mid n\)</span>. Then also <span class="math">\(d' \mid n - km\)</span> by Exercise 1 below. Hence <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> is a common divisor of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. On the other hand, if <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> is a divisor of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(d' \mid r + km\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(d' \mid n\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> is a common divisor of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the sets of common divisors are the same, the largest element in each set is also the same, hence <span class="math">\(\gcd(n,m)=\gcd(m,n-km)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> For all integers <span class="math">\(n\)</span> we have <span class="math">\(\gcd(n,0)=|n|\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Every number is a divisor of 0, hence the greatest common divisor of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and 0 is just the greatest divisor of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, which is the absolute value of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>These two lemmas give us a quick way to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This is called the <em>Euclidean Algorithm</em>. Suppose we want to compute <span class="math">\(\gcd(a, b)\)</span>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We let <span class="math">\(r_0 = a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r_1 = b\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given <span class="math">\(r_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r_{n+1}\)</span> we compute <span class="math">\(r_{n+2}\)</span> as the remainder of of <span class="math">\(r_n\)</span> when divided by <span class="math">\(r_{n+1}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Once <span class="math">\(r_n = 0\)</span>, we stop, and <span class="math">\(\gcd(a, b) = |r_{n-1}|\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This works, because by the lemmas above, we have <span class="math">\(\gcd(r_k,r_{k+1}) = \gcd(r_{k+1}, r_{k+2})\)</span>, since <span class="math">\(r_{k+2} = r_k - qr_{k+1}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(q\)</span>. Hence if <span class="math">\(r_n=0\)</span> we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(r_0,r_1)=\gcd(r_{n-1},r_n)=\gcd(r_{n-1},0)=|r_{n-1}|.\]</div>
<p>For example, suppose we want to compute the greatest common divisor of 1311 and 5757. We compute the following remainders:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}5757 &amp;= 4\times1311 + 513\\
1311 &amp;= 2\times513 + 285\\
513 &amp;= 1\times285 + 228\\
285 &amp;= 1\times228 + 57\\
228 &amp;= 4\times57 + 0.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Hence <span class="math">\(\gcd(1311,5757) = 57\)</span>. This is much quicker than computing all the divisors of both 1311 and 5757.</p>
<p>Here is an important result about greatest common divisors. It is only called a &#8220;lemma&#8221; for historical reasons.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (B&#8206;&#233;zout&#8217;s Lemma). Let <span class="math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> be integers. Then there are integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(as+bt=\gcd(s,t)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We compute <span class="math">\(\gcd(s,t)\)</span> by the Euclidean Algorithm given above, and during the algorithm we get the intermediate values <span class="math">\(r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_n\)</span> where <span class="math">\(r_n = 0\)</span>. Now by induction on <span class="math">\(k\)</span> we prove that we can write <span class="math">\(r_k = a_ks+b_kt\)</span> for some integers <span class="math">\(a_k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_k\)</span>. Indeed: <span class="math">\(r_0 = 1\cdot s + 0\cdot t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r_1 = 0\cdot s + 1\cdot t\)</span>. Now if we assume that <span class="math">\(r_k = a_ks+b_kt\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r_{k+1} = a_{k+1}s+b_{k+1}t\)</span>, we know that <span class="math">\(r_{k+2} = r_k - q\cdot r_{k+1}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the quotient of <span class="math">\(r_k\)</span> when divided by <span class="math">\(r_{k+1}\)</span>. These equations together give</p>
<div class="math">
\[r_{k+2} = (a_k-qa_{k+1})s + (b_k-qb_{k+1})t.\]</div>
<p>This completes the induction. In particular, <span class="math">\(r_{n-1} = a_{n-1}s+b_{n-1}t\)</span>, and since <span class="math">\(\gcd(s,t)=\pm r_{n-1}\)</span> we can write <span class="math">\(\gcd(s,t)\)</span> as <span class="math">\(as+bt\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Corollary.</strong> If <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is any common divisor of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(c \mid \gcd(n, m)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> By B&#8206;&#233;zout&#8217;s Lemma, there are <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\gcd(n,m)=an+bm\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(c\)</span> divides both <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(an+bm\)</span> by Exercise 1 below, and hence also <span class="math">\(\gcd(n,m)\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Of special interest are pairs of integers which have no divisors in common, except 1 and <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Two integers <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> are <em>coprime</em> if <span class="math">\(\gcd(n,m) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> be integers such that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> are coprime. If <span class="math">\(k \mid nm\)</span> then <span class="math">\(k \mid m\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> By B&#8206;&#233;zout&#8217;s Lemma, there are <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(an+bk = 1\)</span>. Multiplying by <span class="math">\(m\)</span> gives <span class="math">\(anm + bkm = m\)</span> Since <span class="math">\(k\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(nm\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k\)</span> divides the left-hand side of the equation, hence <span class="math">\(k \mid m\)</span>.</p>

<h2>19.3. Prime Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#prime-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>In this section we consider properties of prime numbers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> An integer <span class="math">\(p\geq 2\)</span> is called <em>prime</em> if the only positive divisors of <span class="math">\(p\)</span> are 1 and <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. An integer <span class="math">\(n \geq 2\)</span> which is not prime is called <em>composite</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>An equivalent definition of a prime number is a positive number with exactly 2 positive divisors.</p>
<p>Recall from <a class="reference internal" href="the_natural_numbers_and_induction.html#the-natural-numbers-and-induction"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 17</span></a> that every natural number greater than 1 can be written as the product of primes. In particular, ever natural number greater than 1 is divisible by some prime number.</p>
<p>We now prove some other properties about prime numbers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There are infinitely many primes.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there are only finitely many primes <span class="math">\(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(n = p_1 \times p_2 \times \cdots \times p_k\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(i\leq k\)</span> we know that <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span> is not divisible by <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. However, we assumed that these are all primes, contradicting the fact that every number is divisible by a prime number.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is an integer and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is a prime number, then either <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> are coprime or <span class="math">\(p \mid n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(d = \gcd(n, p)\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is a positive divisor of <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, either <span class="math">\(d = 1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(d = p\)</span>. In the first case, <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> are coprime by definition, and in the second case we have <span class="math">\(p \mid n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> are integers and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is a prime number such that <span class="math">\(p \mid nm\)</span> then either <span class="math">\(p \mid n\)</span> or <span class="math">\(p \mid m\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose that <span class="math">\(p \nmid n\)</span>. By the previous lemma, this means that <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> are coprime. From this we can conclude that <span class="math">\(p \mid m\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The last result in this section captures that the primes are the &#8220;building blocks&#8221; of the positive integers for multiplication: all other integers can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Let <span class="math">\(n &gt; 0\)</span> be an integer. Then there are primes <span class="math">\(p_1, \ldots, p_k\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(n = p_1\times \cdots \times p_k\)</span>. Moreover, these primes are unique up to reordering. That means that if there are prime numbers <span class="math">\(q_1, \ldots, q_\ell\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(q_1\times \cdots \times q_\ell = n\)</span>, then the <span class="math">\(q_i\)</span> are a reordering of the <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span>. To be completely precise, this means that there is a bijection <span class="math">\(\sigma : \{1, \ldots, k\} \to \{1, \ldots, k\}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(q_i = p_{\sigma(i)}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> 1 can be written as the product of zero prime numbers. The <em>empty product</em> is defined to be 1.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We have already seen that every number can be written as the product of primes, so we only need to prove the uniqueness up to reordering. Suppose this is not true, and by the least element principle, let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> be the smallest positive integers such that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> can be written as the product of primes in two ways: <span class="math">\(n = p_1\times \cdots \times p_k = q_1 \times \cdots \times q_\ell\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since 1 can be written as product of primes <em>only</em> as empty product, we have <span class="math">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(k \geq 1\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(p_k\)</span> is prime, we must have <span class="math">\(p_k \mid q_j\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(j \leq \ell\)</span>. By swapping <span class="math">\(q_j\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q_\ell\)</span>, we may assume that <span class="math">\(j = \ell\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(q_\ell\)</span> is also prime, we have <span class="math">\(p_k = q_\ell\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we have <span class="math">\(p_1\times \cdots \times p_{k-1} = q_1 \times \cdots \times q_{\ell-1}\)</span>. This product is smaller than <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, but can be written as product of primes in two different ways. But we assumed <span class="math">\(n\)</span> was the smallest such number. Contradiction!</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2>19.4. Modular Arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#modular-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>In the discussion of equivalence relations in <a class="reference internal" href="relations.html#equivalence-relations-and-equality"><span class="std std-numref">Section 13.3</span></a> we considered the example of the relation of modular equivalence on the integers. This is sometimes thought of as &#8220;clock arithmetic.&#8221; Suppose you have a 12-hour clock without a minute hand, so it only has an hour hand which can point to the hours 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and then it wraps to 12 again. We can do arithmetic with this clock.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the hand currently points to 10, then 5 hours later it will point to 3.</li>
<li>If the hand points to 7, then 23 hours before that, it pointed to 8.</li>
<li>If the hand points to 9, and we work for a 8 hours, then when we are done the hand will point to 5. If we worked twice as long, starting at 9, the hand will point to 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to write these statements using mathematical notation, so that we can reason about them more easily. We cannot write <span class="math">\(10 + 5 = 3\)</span> for the first expression, because that would be false, so instead we use the notation <span class="math">\(10 + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}\)</span>. The notation <span class="math">\(\pmod{12}\)</span> indicates that we forget about multiples of 12, and we use the &#8220;congruence&#8221; symbol with three horizontal lines to remind us that these values are not exactly equal, but only equal up to multiples of 12. The other two lines can be formulated as <span class="math">\(7 - 23 \equiv 8 \pmod{12}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(9 + 2 \cdot 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(6 + 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(6 \cdot 7 \equiv 42 \equiv 6 \pmod{12}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(7 \cdot 5 \equiv 35 \equiv -1 \pmod{12}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The last example shows that we can use negative numbers as well.</p>
<p>We now give a precise definition.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> For integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> we say that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are <em>congruent modulo</em> <span class="math">\(n\)</span> if <span class="math">\(n \mid a - b\)</span>. This is written <span class="math">\(a \equiv b \pmod{n}\)</span>. The number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is called the <em>modulus</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Typically we only use this definition when the modulus <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is positive.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Congruence modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is an equivalence relation.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We have to show that congruence modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.</p>
<p>It is reflexive, because <span class="math">\(a - a = 0\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(n \mid a - a\)</span>, and hence <span class="math">\(a\equiv a \pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To show that it is symmetric, suppose that <span class="math">\(a \equiv b \pmod{n}\)</span>. Then by definition, <span class="math">\(n \mid a - b\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(n \mid (-1) \cdot (a - b)\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(n \mid b - a\)</span>. This means by definition that <span class="math">\(b \equiv a \pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To show that it is transitive, suppose that <span class="math">\(a \equiv b \pmod{n}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \equiv c \pmod{n}\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math">\(n \mid a - b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n \mid b - c\)</span>. Hence we have <span class="math">\(n \mid (a - b) + (b - c)\)</span> which means that <span class="math">\(n \mid a - c\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(a \equiv c \pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This theorem justifies the &#8220;chaining&#8221; notation we used above when we wrote <span class="math">\(7 \cdot 5 \equiv 35 \equiv -1 \pmod{12}\)</span>. Since congruence modulo 12 is transitive, we can now actually conclude that <span class="math">\(7\cdot 5\equiv -1 \pmod{12}\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose that <span class="math">\(a\equiv b \pmod{n}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\equiv d\pmod{n}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(a+c\equiv b+d \pmod{n}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\cdot c\equiv b\cdot d\pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, if <span class="math">\(a\equiv b \pmod{n}\)</span> then <span class="math">\(a^k\equiv b^k \pmod{n}\)</span> for all natural numbers <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We know that <span class="math">\(n \mid a - b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n \mid c - d\)</span>. For the first statement, we can calculate that <span class="math">\((a + c) - (b + d) = (a - b) + (c - d)\)</span>, so we can conclude that <span class="math">\(n \mid (a + c) - (b + d)\)</span> hence that <span class="math">\(a+c\equiv b+d\pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the second statement, we want to show that <span class="math">\(n \mid a\cdot c - b\cdot d\)</span>. We can factor <span class="math">\(a\cdot c - b\cdot d = (a - b)\cdot c + b\cdot(c-d)\)</span>. Now <span class="math">\(n\)</span> divides both summands on the right, hence <span class="math">\(n\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(a\cdot c - b\cdot d\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(a\cdot c\equiv b\cdot d\pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The last statement follows by induction on <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(k = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(1\equiv 1 \pmod{n}\)</span>, and for the induction step, suppose that <span class="math">\(a^k\equiv b^k\pmod{n}\)</span>, then we have <span class="math">\(a^{k+1}= a\cdot a^k \equiv b \cdot b^k = b^{k+1} \pmod{n}\)</span></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This theorem is useful for carrying out computations modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Here are some examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Suppose we want to compute <span class="math">\(77 \cdot 123\)</span> modulo 12. We know that <span class="math">\(77 \equiv 5 \pmod{12}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(123 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(77 \cdot 123 \equiv 5 \cdot 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}\)</span></li>
<li>Suppose we want to compute <span class="math">\(99 \cdot 998\)</span> modulo 10. We know that <span class="math">\(99 \equiv -1\pmod{10}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(998 \equiv -2 \pmod{10}\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(99 \cdot 998 \equiv (-1) \cdot (-2) \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Suppose we want to know the last digit of <span class="math">\(101^{101}\)</span>. Notice that the last digit of a number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is congruent to <span class="math">\(n\)</span> modulo 10, so we can just compute <span class="math">\(101^{101} \equiv 1^{101} \equiv 1 \pmod{10}\)</span>. So the last digit of <span class="math">\(101^{101}\)</span> is 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Warning.</em> You cannot do all computations you might expect with modular arithmetic:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Modular arithmetic does not respect division. For example <span class="math">\(12 \equiv 16 \pmod{4}\)</span>, but we cannot divide both sides of the equation by 2, because <span class="math">\(6 \not\equiv 8 \pmod{4}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Exponents also do not respect modular arithmetic. For example <span class="math">\(8 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}\)</span>, but <span class="math">\(2^8 \not\equiv 2^3 \pmod{5}\)</span>. To see this: <span class="math">\(2^8 = 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\)</span>, but <span class="math">\(2^3 = 8 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall the quotient-remainder theorem: if <span class="math">\(n &gt; 0\)</span>, then any integer <span class="math">\(a\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="math">\(a = n q + r\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(0 \le r &lt; n\)</span>. In the language of modular arithmetic this means that <span class="math">\(a \equiv r \pmod{n}\)</span>. So if <span class="math">\(n &gt; 0\)</span>, then every integer is congruent to a number between 0 and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> (inclusive). So there &#8220;are only <span class="math">\(n\)</span> different numbers&#8221; when working modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. This can be used to prove many statements about the natural numbers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> For every integer <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k^2+1\)</span> is not divisible by 3.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Translating this problem to modular arithmetic, we have to show that <span class="math">\(k^2+1 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\)</span> or in other words that <span class="math">\(k^2\not\equiv 2 \pmod{3}\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. By the quotient-remainder theorem, we know that <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is either congruent to 0, 1 or 2, modulo 3. In the first case, <span class="math">\(k^2\equiv 0^2\equiv 0\pmod{3}\)</span>. In the second case, <span class="math">\(k^{2}\equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\)</span>, and in the last case we have <span class="math">\(k^{2}\equiv2^2\equiv4\equiv1\pmod{3}\)</span>. In all of those cases, <span class="math">\(k^2\not\equiv2\pmod{3}\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(k^2+1\)</span> is never divisible by 3.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> For all integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a^2+b^2-3\)</span> is not divisible by 4.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We first compute the squares modulo 4. We compute</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}0^2&amp;\equiv 0\pmod{4}\\
1^2&amp;\equiv 1\pmod{4}\\
2^2&amp;\equiv 0\pmod{4}\\
3^2&amp;\equiv 1\pmod{4}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Since every number is congruent to 0, 1, 2 or 3 modulo 4, we know that every square is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. This means that there are only four possibilities for <span class="math">\(a^2+b^2\pmod{4}\)</span>. It can be congruent to <span class="math">\(0+0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1+0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(0+1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(0+0\)</span>. In all those cases, <span class="math">\(a^2+b^2\not\equiv 3\pmod{4}\)</span> Hence <span class="math">\(4\nmid a^2+b^2-3\)</span>, proving the proposition.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Recall that we warned you about dividing in modular arithmetic. This doesn&#8217;t always work, but often it does. For example, suppose we want to solve <span class="math">\(2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\)</span>. We cannot solve this by saying that <span class="math">\(n \equiv \frac12 \pmod{5}\)</span>, because we cannot work with fractions in modular arithmetic. However, we can still solve it by multiplying both sides with 3. Then we get <span class="math">\(6n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}\)</span>, and since <span class="math">\(6\equiv 1 \pmod{5}\)</span> we get <span class="math">\(n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}\)</span>. So instead of dividing by 2 we could multiply by 3 to get the answer. The reason this worked is because <span class="math">\(2\times 3\equiv 1\pmod{5}\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> be integers. A <em>multiplicative inverse of</em> <span class="math">\(a\)</span> <em>modulo</em> <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is an integer <span class="math">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(ab \equiv 1\pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>For example, 3 is a multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7, since <span class="math">\(3\times 5\equiv1\pmod{7}\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(2\)</span> has no multiplicative inverse modulo 6. Indeed, suppose that <span class="math">\(2b\equiv 1 \pmod{6}\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(6 \mid 2b-1\)</span>. However, <span class="math">\(2b-1\)</span> is odd, and cannot be divisible by an even number. We can use multiplicative inverses to solve equations. If we want to solve <span class="math">\(ax\equiv c \pmod{n}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and we know that <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is a multiplicative inverse of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, the solution is <span class="math">\(x\equiv bc \pmod{n}\)</span> which we can see by multiplying both sides by <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Lemma</strong> Let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> be integers. <span class="math">\(a\)</span> has at most one multiplicative inverse modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. That is, if <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b'\)</span> are both multiplicative inverses of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(b\equiv b'\pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose that <span class="math">\(ab\equiv 1 \equiv ab' \pmod{n}\)</span>. Then we can compute <span class="math">\(bab'\)</span> in two ways: <span class="math">\(b \equiv b(ab') = (ba)b' \equiv b' \pmod{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> be integers. <span class="math">\(a\)</span> has a multiplicative inverse modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> are coprime.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is a multiplicative inverse of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(n \mid ab - 1\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(d = \gcd(a, b)\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(d \mid n\)</span> we have <span class="math">\(d \mid ab-1\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is a divisor of <span class="math">\(ab\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(d \mid ab - (ab-1) = 1\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(d\geq0\)</span> we have <span class="math">\(d=1\)</span>. Hence <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> are coprime.</p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> are coprime. By B&#8206;&#233;zout&#8217;s Lemma we know that there are integers <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(cn+ba=\gcd(n,a)=1\)</span>. We can rewrite this to <span class="math">\(ab - 1 = (-c)n\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(n \mid ab - 1\)</span>, which means by definition <span class="math">\(ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n}\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is a multiplicative inverse of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Note that if <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is a prime number and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is a integer not divisible by <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> are coprime, hence <span class="math">\(a\)</span> has a multiplicative inverse.</p>

<div class="section" id="properties-of-squares">
<h2>19.5. Properties of Squares<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-of-squares" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Mathematicians from ancient times have been interested in the question as to which integers can be written as a sum of two squares. For example, we can write <span class="math">\(2 = 1^1 + 1^1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(5 = 2^2 + 1^2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(13 = 3^2 + 2^2\)</span>. If we make a sufficiently long list of these, an interesting pattern emerges: if two numbers can be written as a sum of two squares, then so can their product. For example, <span class="math">\(10 = 5 \cdot 2\)</span>, and we can write <span class="math">\(10 = 3^2 + 1^2\)</span>. Or <span class="math">\(65 = 13 \cdot 5\)</span>, and we can write <span class="math">\(65 = 8^2 + 1^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>At first, one might wonder whether this is just a coincidence. The following provides a proof of the fact that it is not.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> be any two integers. If <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are both sums of two squares, then so is <span class="math">\(x y\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(x = a^2 + b^2\)</span>, and suppose <span class="math">\(y = c^2 + d^2\)</span>. I claim that</p>
<div class="math">
\[xy = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2.\]</div>
<p>To show this, notice that on the one hand we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[xy = (a^2 + b^2) (c^2 + d^2) = a^2 c^2 + a^2 d^2 + b^2 c^2 + b^2 d^2.\]</div>
<p>On the other hand, we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}(ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2 &amp; = (a^2c^2 - 2abcd + b^2 d^2) + (a^2 d^2 + 2 a b c d + b^2 c^2) \\
 &amp; = a^2 c^2 + b^2 d^2 + a^2 d^2 + b^2 c^2.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Up to the order of summands, the two right-hand sides are the same.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We will now prove that <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is not a fraction of two integers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There are no integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\frac ab=\sqrt{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose that <span class="math">\(\frac ab=\sqrt{2}\)</span> for some integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. By canceling common factors, we may assume that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are coprime. By squaring both sides, we get <span class="math">\(\frac{a^2}{b^2}=2\)</span>, and multiplying both sides by <span class="math">\(b^2\)</span> gives <span class="math">\(a^2=2b^2\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(2b^2\)</span> is even, we know that <span class="math">\(a^2\)</span> is even, and since odd squares are odd, we conclude that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is even. Hence we can write <span class="math">\(a = 2c\)</span> for some integer <span class="math">\(c\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\((2c)^2=2b^2\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(2c^2=b^2\)</span>. The same reasoning shows that <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is even. But we assumed that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are coprime, which contradicts the fact that they are both even.</p>
<p>Hence there are no integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\frac ab=\sqrt{2}\)</span>.</p>
