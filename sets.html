<p>We have come to a turning point in this textbook. We will henceforth abandon natural deduction, for the most part, and focus on ordinary mathematical proofs. We will continue to think about how informal mathematics can be represented in symbolic terms, and how the rules of natural deduction play out in the informal setting. But the emphasis will be on writing ordinary mathematical arguments, not designing proof trees. Lean will continue to serve as a bridge between the informal and formal realms.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we consider a notion that has come to play a fundamental role in mathematical reasoning, namely, that of a &#8220;set.&#8221;</p>
<div class="section" id="elementary-set-theory">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>11.1. Elementary Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#elementary-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>In a publication in the journal <em>Mathematische Annalen</em> in 1895, the German mathematician Georg Cantor presented the following
characterization of the notion of a <em>set</em> (or <em>Menge</em>, in his terminology):</p>
<blockquote>
<div>By a <em>set</em> we mean any collection M of determinate, distinct objects (called the <em>elements</em> of M) of our intuition or thought into a whole.</div></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the notion of a set has been used to unify a wide range of abstractions and constructions. Axiomatic set theory, which we will discuss in a later chapter, provides a foundation for mathematics in which everything can be viewed as a set.</p>
<p>On a broad construal, <em>any</em> collection can be a set; for example, we can consider the set whose elements are Ringo Star, the number 7, and the set whose only member is the Empire State Building. With such a broad notion of set we have to be careful: Russell&#8217;s paradox has us consider the set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> of all sets that are not elements of themselves, which leads to a contradiction when we ask whether <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is an element of itself. (Try it!) The axioms of set theory tell us which sets exist, and have been carefully designed to avoid paradoxical sets like that of the Russell paradox.</p>
<p>In practice, mathematicians are not so freewheeling in their use of sets. Typically, one fixes a domain such as the natural numbers, and consider subsets of that domain. In other words, we consider sets of numbers, sets of points, sets of lines, and so on, rather than arbitrary &#8220;sets.&#8221; In this text, we will adopt this convention: when we talk about sets, we are always implicitly talking about sets of elements of some domain.</p>
<p>Given a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> of objects in some domain and an object <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, we write <span class="math">\(x \in A\)</span> to say that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is an element of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Cantor&#8217;s characterization suggests that whenever we have some property, <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, of a domain, we can form the set of elements that have that property. This is denoted using &#8220;set-builder notation&#8221; as <span class="math">\(\{ x \mid P(x) \}\)</span>. For example, we can consider all the following sets of natural numbers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\{n \mid \mbox{$n$ is even} \}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\{n \mid \mbox{$n$ is prime} \}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\{n \mid \mbox{$n$ is prime and greater than 2} \}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\{n \mid \mbox{$n$ can be written as a sum of squares} \}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\{n \mid \mbox{$n$ is equal to 1, 2, or 3}\}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This last set is written more simply <span class="math">\(\{1, 2, 3\}\)</span>. If the domain is not clear from the context, we can specify it by writing it explicitly, for example, in the expression <span class="math">\(\{n \in \mathbb{N} \mid \text{$n$ is even} \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using set-builder notation, we can define a number of common sets and operations. The <em>empty set</em>, <span class="math">\(\emptyset\)</span>, is the set with no elements:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\emptyset = \{ x \mid \mbox{false} \}.\]</div>
<p>Dually, we can define the <em>universal set</em>, <span class="math">\(\mathcal U\)</span>, to be the set consisting of every element of the domain:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal U = \{ x \mid \mbox{true} \}.\]</div>
<p>Given two sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, we define their <em>union</em> to be the set of elements in either one:</p>
<div class="math">
\[A \cup B = \{ x \mid \mbox{$x \in A$ or $x \in B$} \}.\]</div>
<p>And we define their <em>intersection</em> to be the set of elements of both:</p>
<div class="math">
\[A \cap B = \{ x \mid \mbox{$x \in A$ and $x \in B$} \}.\]</div>
<p>We define the <em>complement</em> of a set of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to be the set of elements that are not in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\overline A = \{ x \mid \mbox{$x \notin A$} \}.\]</div>
<p>We define the <em>set difference</em> of two sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> to be the set of elements in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> but not <span class="math">\(B\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[A \setminus B = \{ x \mid \mbox{$x \in A$ and $x \notin B$} \}.\]</div>
<p>Two sets are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements. If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are sets, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is said to be a <em>subset</em> of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, written <span class="math">\(A \subseteq B\)</span>, if every element of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is an element of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is equal to <span class="math">\(B\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice also that just everything we have said about sets so far is readily representable in symbolic logic. We can render the defining properties of the basic sets and constructors as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in \emptyset \leftrightarrow \bot)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in \mathcal U \leftrightarrow \top)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in A \cup B \leftrightarrow x \in A \vee x \in B)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in A \cap B \leftrightarrow x \in A \wedge x \in B)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in \overline A \leftrightarrow x \notin A)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in A \setminus B \leftrightarrow  x \in A \wedge x \notin B)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The assertion that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span> can be written <span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in A \to x \in B)\)</span>, and the assertion that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is equal to be can be written <span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in A \leftrightarrow  x \in B)\)</span>. These are all <em>universal</em> statements, that is, statements with universal quantifiers in front, followed by basic assertions and propositional connectives. What this means is that reasoning about sets formally often amounts to using nothing more than the rules for the universal quantifier together with the rules for propositional logic.</p>
<p>Logicians sometimes describe ordinary mathematical proofs as <em>informal</em>, in contrast to the <em>formal proofs</em> in natural deduction. When writing informal proofs, the focus is on readability. Here is an example.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> denote sets of elements of some domain. Then <span class="math">\(A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(x\)</span> be arbitrary, and suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap (B \cup C)\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and either <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> or <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(C\)</span>. In the first case, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and hence in <span class="math">\(A \cap B\)</span>. In the second case, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, and hence <span class="math">\(A \cap C\)</span>. Either way, we have that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\((A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\((A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)\)</span>. There are now two cases.</p>
<p>First, suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap B\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, it is also in <span class="math">\(B \cup C\)</span>, and so <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap (B \cup C)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The second case is similar: suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap C\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, and so also in <span class="math">\(B \cup C\)</span>. Hence, in this case also, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap (B \cup C)\)</span>, as required.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Notice that this proof does not look anything like a proof in symbolic logic. For one thing, ordinary proofs tend to favor words over symbols. Of course, mathematics uses symbols all the time, but not in place of words like &#8220;and&#8221; and &#8220;not&#8221;; you will rarely, if ever, see the symbols <span class="math">\(\wedge\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\neg\)</span> in a mathematics textbook, unless it is a textbook specifically about logic.</p>
<p>Similarly, the structure of an informal proof is conveyed with ordinary paragraphs and punctuation. Don&#8217;t rely on pictorial diagrams, line breaks, and indentation to convey the structure of a proof. Rather, you should rely on literary devices like signposting and foreshadowing. It is often helpful to present an outline of a proof or the key ideas before delving into the details, and the introductory sentence of a paragraph can help guide a reader&#8217;s expectations, just as it does in an expository essay.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you should be able to see elements of natural deduction implicitly in the proof above. In formal terms, the theorem is equivalent to the assertion</p>
<div class="math">
\[\forall x \; (x \in A \cap (B \cup C) \leftrightarrow  x \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)),\]</div>
<p>and the proof proceeds accordingly. The phrase &#8220;let <span class="math">\(x\)</span> be arbitrary&#8221; is code for the <span class="math">\(\forall\)</span> introduction rule, and the form of the rest of the proof is a <span class="math">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> introduction. Saying that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap (B \cup C)\)</span> is implicitly an &#8220;and,&#8221; and the argument uses <span class="math">\(\wedge\)</span> elimination to get <span class="math">\(x \in A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x \in B \cup C\)</span>. Saying <span class="math">\(x \in B \cup C\)</span> is implicitly an &#8220;or,&#8221; and the proof then splits on cases, depending on whether <span class="math">\(x \in B\)</span> or <span class="math">\(x \in C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Modulo the unfolding of definition of intersection and union in terms of &#8220;and&#8221; and &#8220;or,&#8221; the &#8220;only if&#8221; direction of the previous proof could be represented in natural deduction like this:</p>
<img src="_static/natural_deduction_for_first_order_logic.1.png"><p>In the next chapter, we will see that this logical structure is made manifest in Lean. But writing long proofs in natural deduction is not the most effective to communicate the mathematical ideas. So our goal here is to teach you to think in terms of natural deduction rules, but express the steps in ordinary English.</p>
<p>Here is another example.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math">\((A \setminus B) \setminus C = A \setminus (B \cup C)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(x\)</span> be arbitrary, and suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\((A \setminus B) \setminus C\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \setminus B\)</span> but not <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, and hence it is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> but not in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> or <span class="math">\(C\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> but not <span class="math">\(B \cup C\)</span>, and so in <span class="math">\(A \setminus (B \cup C)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \setminus (B \cup C)\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, but not in <span class="math">\(B \cup C\)</span>. In particular, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in neither <span class="math">\(B\)</span> nor <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, because otherwise it would be in <span class="math">\(B \cup C\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \setminus B\)</span>, and hence in <span class="math">\((A \setminus B) \setminus C\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Perhaps the biggest difference between informal proofs and formal proofs is the level of detail. Informal proofs will often skip over details that are taken to be &#8220;straightforward&#8221; or &#8220;obvious,&#8221; devoting more effort to spelling out inferences that are novel of unexpected.</p>
<p>Writing a good proof is like writing a good essay. To convince your readers that the conclusion is correct, you have to get them to understand the argument, without overwhelming them with unnecessary details. It helps to have a specific audience in mind. Try speaking the argument aloud to friends, roommates, and family members; if their eyes glaze over, it is unreasonable to expect anonymous readers to do better.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to learn to write good proofs is to <em>read</em> good proofs, and pay attention to the style of writing. Pick an example of a textbook that you find especially clear and engaging, and think about what makes it so.</p>
<p>Natural deduction and formal verification can help you understand the components that make a proof <em>correct</em>, but you will have to develop an intuitive feel for what makes a proof easy and enjoyable to read.</p>

<h2>11.2. Calculations with Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#calculations-with-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Calculation is a central to mathematics, and mathematical proofs often involve carrying out a sequence of calculations. Indeed, a calculation can be viewed as a proof in and of itself that two expressions describe the same entity.</p>
<p>In high school algebra, students are often asked to prove identities like the following:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> <span class="math">\(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n + 1) = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\)</span>, for every natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In some places, students are asked to write proofs like this:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n + 1) &amp; =? \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\
\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \frac{2n + 2}{2} &amp; =? \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} \\
\frac{n^2+n + 2n + 2}{2} &amp; =? \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} \\
\frac{n^2+3n + 2}{2} &amp; = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}. \\\end{split}\]</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Mathematicians generally cringe when they see this. <em>Don&#8217;t do it!</em> It looks like an instance of forward reasoning, where we start with a complex identity and end up proving <span class="math">\(x = x\)</span>. Of course, what is really meant is that each line follows from the next. There is a way of expressing this, with the phrase &#8220;it suffices to show.&#8221; The following presentation comes closer to mathematical vernacular:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We want to show</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n + 1) = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}.\]</div>
<p>To do that, it suffices to show</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \frac{2n + 2}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}.\]</div>
<p>For that, it suffices to show</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{n^2+n + 2n + 2}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}.\]</div>
<p>But this last equation is clearly true.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The narrative doesn&#8217;t flow well, however. Sometimes there are good reasons to work backward in a proof, but in this case it is easy to present the proof in a more forward-directed manner. Here is one example:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Calculating on the left-hand side, we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n + 1) &amp; = \frac{n^2+n}{2} + \frac{2n + 2}{2} \\
  &amp; = \frac{n^2+n + 2n + 2}{2} \\
  &amp; = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>On the right-hand side, we also have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}.\]</div>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n + 1) = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}\)</span>, as required.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Mathematicians often use the abbreviations &#8220;LHS&#8221; and &#8220;RHS&#8221; for &#8220;left-hand side&#8221; and &#8220;right-hand side,&#8221; respectively, in situations like this. In fact, here we can easily write the proof as a single forward-directed calculation:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n + 1) &amp; = \frac{n^2+n}{2} + \frac{2n + 2}{2} \\
  &amp; = \frac{n^2+n + 2n + 2}{2} \\
  &amp; = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} \\
  &amp; = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}.\end{split}\]</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Such a proof is clear, compact, and easy to read. The main challenge to the reader is to figure out what justifies each subsequent step. Mathematicians sometimes annotate such a calculation with additional information, or add a few words of explanation in the text before and/or after. But the ideal situation is to carry out the calculation is small enough steps so that each step is straightforward, and needs to no explanation. (And, once again, what counts as &#8220;straightforward&#8221; will vary depending on who is reading the proof.)</p>
<p>We have said that two sets are equal if they have the same elements. In the previous section, we proved that two sets are equal by reasoning about the elements of each, but we can often be more efficient. Assuming <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> are subsets of some domain <span class="math">\(\mathcal U\)</span>, the following identities hold:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup \overline A = \mathcal U\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap \overline A = \emptyset\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\overline {\overline A} = A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup A = A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap A = A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup \emptyset = A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup \mathcal U = \mathcal U\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap \mathcal U = A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup B = B \cup A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap B = B \cap A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\((A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\((A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\overline{A \cap B} = \overline A \cup \overline B\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\overline{A \cup B} = \overline A \cap \overline B\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap (A \cup B) = A\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup (A \cap B) = A\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This allows us to prove further identities by calculating. Here is an example.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>. Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> be subsets of some domain <span class="math">\(\mathcal U\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\((A \cap \overline B) \cup B = A \cup B\)</span>.</p>

<p>Classically, you may have noticed that propositions, under logical equivalence, satisfy identities similar to sets. That is no coincidence; both are instances of <em>boolean algebras</em>. Here are the identities above translated to the language of a boolean algebra:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(A \vee \neg A = \top\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \wedge \neg A = \bot\)</span></li>

<h2>11.3. Indexed Families of Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#indexed-families-of-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>If <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is a set, we will sometimes wish to consider a <em>family</em> <span class="math">\((A_i)_{i \in I}\)</span> of sets indexed by elements of <span class="math">\(I\)</span>. For example, we might be interested in a sequence</p>
<div class="math">
\[A_0, A_1, A_2, \ldots\]</div>
<p>of sets indexed by the natural numbers. The concept is best illustrated by some examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For each natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, we can define the set <span class="math">\(A_n\)</span> to be the set of people alive today that are of age <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. For each age we have the corresponding set. Someone of age 20 is an element of the set <span class="math">\(A_{20}\)</span>, while a newborn baby is an element of <span class="math">\(A_0\)</span>. The set <span class="math">\(A_{200}\)</span> is empty. This family <span class="math">\((A_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\)</span> is a is a family of sets indexed by the natural numbers.</li>
<li>For every real number <span class="math">\(r\)</span> we can define <span class="math">\(B_r\)</span> to be the set of positive real numbers larger than <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(B_r = \{x\in \mathbb{R} \mid x &gt; r \text{ and } x &gt; 0\}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\((B_r)_{r\in\mathbb{R}}\)</span> is a family of sets indexed by the real numbers.</li>
<li>For every natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> we can define <span class="math">\(C_n=\{k\in\mathbb{N} \mid k \text{ is a divisor of } n\}\)</span> as the set of divisors of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a family <span class="math">\((A_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> of sets indexed by <span class="math">\(I\)</span>, we can form its <em>union</em>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = \{ x \mid x \in A_i \text{ for some $i \in I$} \}.\]</div>
<p>We can also form the <em>intersection</em> of a family of sets:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i = \{ x \mid x \in A_i \text{ for every $i \in I$} \}.\]</div>
<p>So an element <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span> for <em>some</em> <span class="math">\(i\)</span> in <span class="math">\(I\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span> for every <span class="math">\(i\)</span> in <span class="math">\(I\)</span>. These operations are represented in symbolic logic by the existential and the universal quantifiers. We have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \leftrightarrow \exists i \in I \; (x \in A_i))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (x \in \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \leftrightarrow \forall i \in I \; (x \in A_i))\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Returning to the examples above, we can compute the union and intersection of each family. For the first example, <span class="math">\(\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n\)</span> is the set of all living people, and <span class="math">\(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n = \emptyset\)</span>. Also, <span class="math">\(\bigcup_{r \in \mathbb{R}} B_r = \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\)</span>, the set of all positive real numbers, and <span class="math">\(\bigcap_{r \in \mathbb{R}} B_r = \emptyset\)</span>. For the last example, we have <span class="math">\(\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n = \mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n = \{1\}\)</span>, since 1 is a divisor of every natural number.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math">\(I\)</span> contains just two elements, say <span class="math">\(I=\{c, d\}\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\((A_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> be a family of sets indexed by <span class="math">\(I\)</span>. Because <span class="math">\(I\)</span> has two elements, this family consists of just the two sets <span class="math">\(A_c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A_d\)</span>. Then the union and intersection of this family are just the union and intersection of the two sets:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i &amp;= A_c \cup A_d\\
\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i &amp;= A_c \cap A_d.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>This means that the union and intersection of two sets are just a special case of the union and intersection of a family of sets.</p>
<p>We also have equalities for unions and intersections of families of sets. Here are a few of them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (A \cap B_i)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup \bigcap_{i \in I} B_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (A \cup B_i)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\overline{\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i} = \bigcup_{i \in I} \overline{A_i}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\overline{\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i} = \bigcap_{i \in I} \overline{A_i}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\bigcup_{i \in I} \bigcup_{j \in J} A_{i,j} = \bigcup_{j \in J} \bigcup_{i \in I} A_{i,j}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\bigcap_{i \in I} \bigcap_{j \in J} A_{i,j} = \bigcap_{j \in J} \bigcap_{i \in I} A_{i,j}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the last two lines, <span class="math">\(A_{i,j}\)</span> is indexed by two sets <span class="math">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math">\(J\)</span>. This means that for every <span class="math">\(i \in I\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\in J\)</span> we have a set <span class="math">\(A_{i,j}\)</span>. For the first four equalities, try to figure out what the rule means if the index set <span class="math">\(I\)</span> contains two elements.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s prove the first identity. Notice how the logical forms of the assertions <span class="math">\(x \in A \cap \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x \in \bigcup_{i \in I} (A \cap B_i)\)</span> dictate the structure of the proof.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> be any subset of some domain <span class="math">\(U\)</span>, and let <span class="math">\((B_i)_{i \in I}\)</span> be a family of subsets of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> indexed by <span class="math">\(I\)</span>. Then</p>
<div class="math">
\[A \cap \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} (A \cap B_i).\]</div>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(B_j\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(j \in I\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap B_j\)</span>, and hence in <span class="math">\(\bigcup_{i \in I} (A \cap B_i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(\bigcup_{i \in I} (A \cap B_i)\)</span>. Then, for some <span class="math">\(j\)</span> in <span class="math">\(I\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap B_j\)</span>. Hence <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and since <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(B_j\)</span>, it is in <span class="math">\(\bigcup_{i \in I} B_i\)</span>. Hence <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A \cap \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i\)</span>, as required.</p>

<span id="id3"></span><h2>11.4. Cartesian Product and Power Set<a class="headerlink" href="#cartesian-product-and-power-set" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>The <em>ordered pair</em> of two objects <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is denoted <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span>. We say that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the <em>first component</em> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the <em>second component</em> of the pair. Two pairs are only equal if the first component are equal and the second components are equal. In symbols, <span class="math">\((a, b) = (c, d)\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(a = c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b = d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given two sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, we define the <em>cartesian product</em> <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> of these two sets as the set of all pairs where the first component is an element in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and the second component is an element in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. In set-builder notation this means</p>
<div class="math">
\[A \times B = \{(a, b) \; \mid a \; \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}.\]</div>
<p>Note that if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are subsets of a particular domain <span class="math">\(\mathcal U\)</span>, the set <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> need not be a subset of the same domain. However, it will be a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathcal U \times \mathcal U\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some axiomatic foundations take the notion of a pair to be primitive. In axiomatic set theory, it is common to <em>define</em> an ordered pair to be a particular set, namely</p>
<div class="math">
\[(a, b) = \{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}.\]</div>
<p>Notice that if <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>, this set has only one element:</p>
<div class="math">
\[(a, a) = \{\{a\},\{a, a\}\} = \{\{a\},\{a\}\} = \{\{a\}\}.\]</div>
<p>The following theorem shows that this definition is reasonable.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Using the definition of ordered pairs above, we have <span class="math">\((a, b) = (c, d)\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(a = c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b = d\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> If <span class="math">\(a = c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b = d\)</span> then clearly <span class="math">\((a, b) = (c, d)\)</span>. For the other direction, suppose that <span class="math">\((a, b) = (c, d)\)</span>, which means</p>
<div class="math">
\[\underbrace{\{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}}_L = \underbrace{\{\{c\}, \{c, d\}\}}_R.\]</div>
<p>Suppose first that <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(L = \{\{a\}\}\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\(\{c\} = \{a\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\{c, d\} = \{a\}\)</span>, from which we conclude that <span class="math">\(c = a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d = a = b\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that <span class="math">\(a \neq b\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(\{c\} = \{a, b\}\)</span> then we conclude that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are both equal to <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, contradicting <span class="math">\(a \neq b\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(\{c\}\in L\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\{c\}\)</span> must be equal to <span class="math">\(\{a\}\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(a = c\)</span>. We know that <span class="math">\(\{a, b\} \in R\)</span>, and since we know <span class="math">\(\{a, b\}\neq \{c\}\)</span>, we conclude <span class="math">\(\{a, b\} = \{c, d\}\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\(b \in\{c, d\}\)</span>, since <span class="math">\(b \neq a = c\)</span>, we conclude that <span class="math">\(b = d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence in both cases we conclude that <span class="math">\(a = c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b = d\)</span>, proving the theorem.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Using ordered pairs we can define the <em>ordered triple</em> <span class="math">\((a, b, c)\)</span> to be <span class="math">\((a, (b, c))\)</span>. Then we can prove that <span class="math">\((a, b, c) = (d, e, f)\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(a = d\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b = e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c = f\)</span>, which you are asked to do in the exercises. We can also define ordered <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-tuples, which are sequence of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> objects, in a similar way.</p>
<p>Given a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> we can define the <em>power set</em> <span class="math">\(\mathcal P(A)\)</span> to be the set of all subsets of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. In set-builder notation we can write this as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal P(A) = \{B \mid B \subseteq A\}.\]</div>
<p>If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathcal U\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathcal P(A)\)</span> may not be a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathcal U\)</span>, but it is always a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathcal P(\mathcal U)\)</span>.</p>
