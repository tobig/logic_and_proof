<div class="section" id="the-number-systems">
<h2>21.1. The Number Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#the-number-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>We have already come across some of the fundamental number systems: the natural numbers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, the integers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, and the rationals, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. In a sense, each subsequent element of the list was designed to remedy defects in the previous system. We can subtract any integer from any other integer and end up with another integer, and we can divide any rational number by a nonzero rational number and end up with a rational number.</p>
<p>The integers satisfy all of the following properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Addition is associative and commutative.</li>
<li>There is an additive identity, <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and every element <span class="math">\(x\)</span> has an additive inverse, <span class="math">\(-x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Multiplication is associative and commutative.</li>
<li>There is a multiplicative identity, <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Multiplication distributes over addition: for every <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(x (y + z) = x y + x z\)</span>.</li>
<li>The ordering <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> is a total order.</li>
<li>For any elements <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(x \leq y\)</span> then <span class="math">\(x + z \leq y + z\)</span>.</li>
<li>For any elements <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(0 \leq x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0 \leq y\)</span> then <span class="math">\(0 \leq x y\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first five clauses say that with <span class="math">\(\times\)</span>, <span class="math">\(+\)</span>, <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, the integers form a <em>commutative ring</em>, and the last three say that together with <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>, the structure is an <em>ordered ring</em>. The natural numbers lack additive inverses, so they satisfy a slightly weaker set of axioms that make them an <em>ordered semiring</em>. On the other hand, the rational numbers also form an ordered ring, satisfying the following additional property:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, <span class="math">\(x^{-1}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes them an instance of an <em>ordered field</em>.</p>
<p>It is worth knowing that once we have the natural numbers, it is possible to <em>construct</em> the integers and rational numbers, using set-theoretic constructions you have already seen. For example, we can take an integer to be a pair <span class="math">\((i, n)\)</span> of natural numbers where <span class="math">\(i\)</span> is either 0 or 1, with the intention that <span class="math">\((0, n)\)</span> represents the positive integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and <span class="math">\((1, n)\)</span> represents the negative integer <span class="math">\(-(n+1)\)</span>. (We use <span class="math">\(-(n+1)\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\(-n\)</span> to avoid having two representations of <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.) With this definition, the integers are simply <span class="math">\(\{0, 1\} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span>. We can then go on to define the operations of addition and multiplication, the additive inverse, and the order relation, and prove they have the desired properties.</p>
<p>This construction has the side effect that the natural numbers themselves are not integers; for example, we have to distinguish between the natural number <span class="math">\(2\)</span> and the integer <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. This is the case in Lean. In ordinary mathematics, it is common to think of the natural numbers as a subset of the integers. Once we construct the integers, however, we can throw away the old version of the natural numbers, and afterwards identify the natural numbers as nonnegative integers.</p>
<p>We can do the same for the rationals, defining them to be the set of pairs <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span>, where either <span class="math">\(a = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b = 1\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(b &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> have no common divisor (other than <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>). The idea is that <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span> represents <span class="math">\(a / b\)</span>. With this definition, the rationals are really a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span>, and we can then define all the operations accordingly.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will define a more sophisticated approach, one which will scale to a definition of the real numbers. And in a later chapter, we will show how to construct the natural numbers from the axioms of set theory. This shows that we can construct all the number systems from the bottom up.</p>
<p>But first, let us pause for a moment to consider why the real numbers are needed. We have seen that <span class="math">\(2\)</span> has no rational square root. This means, in a sense, that there is a &#8220;gap&#8221; in the rationals: the are rationals whose squares are arbitrarily close to 2, but there is no rational <span class="math">\(x\)</span> with the property that <span class="math">\(x^2 = 2\)</span>. But it seems intuitively clear that there should be some <em>number</em> with that property: <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is the length of the diagonal of a square with side length <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>, the area of a circle with radius 1, is missing from the rationals. These are the kinds of defects that the real numbers are designed to repair.</p>
<p>You may be used to thinking of real numbers as (potentially) infinite decimals: for example, <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356\ldots\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi = 3.14159265\ldots\)</span>. A central goal of this chapter is to make the &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; precise. The idea is that we can take an infinite decimal to represent a sequence of rational approximations. For example, we can approximate the square root of 2 with the sequence <span class="math">\(1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \ldots\)</span>. We would like to define <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> to be the &#8220;limit&#8221; of that sequence, but we have seen that the sequence does not have a limit in the rationals. So we have to construct new objects, the real numbers, to serve that purpose.</p>
<p>In fact, we will define the real numbers, more or less, to <em>be</em> such sequences of rational approximations. But we will have to deal with the fact that, for example, there are <em>lots</em> of ways of approximating the square root of two. For example, we can just as well approach it from above, <span class="math">\(2, 1.5, 1.42, \ldots\)</span>, or by oscillating above and below. The next section will show us how to &#8220;glue&#8221; all these sequences together and treat them as a single object.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2>21.2. Quotient Constructions<a class="headerlink" href="#quotient-constructions" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> be any set, and let <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> be any equivalence relation on <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Recall from <a class="reference internal" href="relations.html#equivalence-relations-and-equality"><span class="std std-numref">Section 13.3</span></a> that we can assign to every element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> the equivalence class <span class="math">\([a]\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(b \in [a]\)</span> means <span class="math">\(b \equiv a\)</span>. This assignment has the property that for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a \equiv b\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\([a] = [b]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given any set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and equivalence relation <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span>, define <span class="math">\(A / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span> to be the set <span class="math">\(\{ [ a ] \mid a \in A \}\)</span> of <em>equivalence classes</em> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span>. This set is called &#8220;<span class="math">\(A\)</span> modulo <span class="math">\(\mathord{\equiv}\)</span>,&#8221; or the <em>quotient</em> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span>. You can think of this as the set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> where equivalent elements are &#8220;glued together&#8221; to make a coarser set.</p>
<p>For example, if we consider the integers <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> denoting equivalence modulo 5 (as in <a class="reference internal" href="elementary_number_theory.html#modular-arithmetic"><span class="std std-numref">Section 19.4</span></a>), then <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z} / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span> is just <span class="math">\(\{ [0], [1], [2], [3], [4] \}\)</span>. We can define addition on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z} / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span> by <span class="math">\([a] + [b] = [a + b]\)</span>. For this definition to make sense, it is important to know that the right-hand side does not depend on which representatives of <span class="math">\([a]\)</span> and <span class="math">\([b]\)</span> we choose. In other words, we need to know that whenever <span class="math">\([a] = [a']\)</span> and <span class="math">\([b] = [b']\)</span>, then <span class="math">\([a + b] = [a' + b']\)</span>. This, in turn, is equivalent to saying that if <span class="math">\(a \equiv a'\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \equiv b'\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(a + b \equiv a' + b'\)</span>. In other words, we require that the operation of addition <em>respects</em> the equivalence relation, and we saw in <a class="reference internal" href="elementary_number_theory.html#modular-arithmetic"><span class="std std-numref">Section 19.4</span></a> that this is in fact the case.</p>
<p>This general strategy for transferring a function defined on a set to a function defined on a quotient of that set is given by the following theorem.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> be any sets, let <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> be any equivalence relation defined on <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and let <span class="math">\(f : A \to B\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math">\(f\)</span> respects the equivalence relation, which is to say, for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a'\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(a \equiv a'\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(f(a) = f(a')\)</span>. Then there is a unique function <span class="math">\(\bar f : A / \mathord{\equiv} \to B\)</span>, defined by <span class="math">\(\bar f ([a]) = f(a)\)</span> for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We have defined the value of <span class="math">\(\bar f\)</span> on an equivalence class <span class="math">\(x\)</span> by writing <span class="math">\(x = [a]\)</span>, and setting <span class="math">\(\bar f(x) = f(a)\)</span>. In other words, we say that <span class="math">\(\bar f(x) = y\)</span> if and only if there is an <span class="math">\(a\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(x = [a]\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(f(a) = y\)</span>. What is dubious about the definition is that, a priori, it might depend on how we express <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in that form; in other words, we need to show that there is a <em>unique</em> <span class="math">\(y\)</span> meeting this description. Specifically, we need to know that if <span class="math">\(x = [a] = [a']\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(f(a) = f(a')\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\([a] = [a']\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math">\(a \equiv a'\)</span>, this amounts to saying that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> respects the equivalence relation, which is exactly what we have assumed.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Mathematicians often &#8220;define&#8221; <span class="math">\(\bar f\)</span> by the equation <span class="math">\(\bar f ([a])= f(a)\)</span>, and then express the proof above as a proof that &#8220;<span class="math">\(\bar f\)</span> is well defined.&#8221; This is confusing. What they really mean is what the theorem says, namely, that there is a unique function meeting that description.</p>
<p>To construct the integers, start with <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span>. Think of the pair of natural numbers <span class="math">\((m, n)\)</span> as representing <span class="math">\(m - n\)</span>, where the subtraction takes place in the integers (which we haven&#8217;t constructed yet!). For example, both <span class="math">\((2, 5)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((6, 9)\)</span> represent the integer <span class="math">\(-3\)</span>. Intuitively, the pairs <span class="math">\((m, n)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((m', n')\)</span> will represent the same integer when <span class="math">\(m - n = m' - n'\)</span>, but we cannot say this yet, because we have not yet defined the appropriate notion of subtraction. But the equation is equivalent to <span class="math">\(m + n' = m' + n\)</span>, and <em>this</em> makes sense with addition on the natural numbers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Define the relation <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span> by <span class="math">\((m, n) \equiv (m', n')\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(m + n' = m' + n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> is an equivalence relation.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> For reflexivity, it is clear that <span class="math">\((m, n) \equiv (m, n)\)</span>, since <span class="math">\(m + n = m + n\)</span>.</p>
<p>For symmetry, suppose <span class="math">\((m, n) \equiv (m', n')\)</span>. This means <span class="math">\(m + n' = m' + n\)</span>. But the symmetry of equality implies <span class="math">\((m', n') \equiv (m, n)\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>For transitivity, suppose <span class="math">\((m, n) \equiv (m', n')\)</span>, and <span class="math">\((m', n') = (m'', n'')\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math">\(m + n' = m' + n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m' + n'' = n' + m''\)</span>. Adding these equations, we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[m + n' + m' + n'' = m' + n + n' + m''.\]</div>
<p>Subtracting <span class="math">\(m' + n'\)</span> from both sides, we get <span class="math">\(m + n'' = n + m''\)</span>, which is equivalent to <span class="math">\((m, n) = (m'', n'')\)</span>, as required.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We can now define the integers to be <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span>. How should we define addition? If <span class="math">\([(m, n)]\)</span> represents <span class="math">\(m - n\)</span>, and <span class="math">\([(u, v)]\)</span> represents <span class="math">\(u - v\)</span>, then <span class="math">\([(m, n)] + [(u, v)]\)</span> should represent <span class="math">\((m + u) - (n + v)\)</span>. Thus, it makes sense to define <span class="math">\([(m, n)] + [(u, v)]\)</span> to be <span class="math">\([(m + u) - (n + v)]\)</span>. For this to work, we need to know that the operation which sends <span class="math">\((m, n)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((u, v)\)</span> to <span class="math">\((m + u, n + v)\)</span> respects the equivalence relation.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> If <span class="math">\((m, n) \equiv (m', n')\)</span> and <span class="math">\((u, v) \equiv (u', v')\)</span>, then <span class="math">\((m + u, n + v) \equiv (m' + u', n' + v')\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> The first equivalence means <span class="math">\(m + n' = m' + n\)</span>, and the second means <span class="math">\(u + v' = u' + v\)</span>. Adding the two equations, we get <span class="math">\((m + u) + (n' + v') \equiv (m' + u') + (n + v)\)</span>, which is exactly the same as saying <span class="math">\((m + u, n + v) \equiv (m' + u', n' + v')\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Every natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> can be represented by the integer <span class="math">\([(n, 0)]\)</span>, and, in particular, <span class="math">\(0\)</span> is represented by <span class="math">\([(0, 0)]\)</span>. Moreover, if <span class="math">\([(m, n)]\)</span> is any integer, we can define its negation to be <span class="math">\([(n, m)]\)</span>, since <span class="math">\([(m, n)] + [(n, m)] = [(m + n, n + m)] = [(0, 0)]\)</span>, since <span class="math">\((m + n, n + m) \equiv (0, 0)\)</span>. In short, we have &#8220;invented&#8221; the negative numbers!</p>
<p>We could go on this way to define multiplication and the ordering on the integers, and prove that they have the desired properties. We could also carry out a similar construction for the rational numbers. Here, we would start with the set <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}^{&gt;0}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}^{&gt;0}\)</span> denotes the strictly positive integers. The idea, of course, is that <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span> represents <span class="math">\((a / b)\)</span>. With that in mind, it makes sense to define <span class="math">\((a, b) \equiv (c, d)\)</span> if <span class="math">\(a d = b c\)</span>. We could go on to define addition, multiplication, and the ordering there, too. The details are tedious, however, and not very illuminating. So we turn, instead, to a construction of the real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="constructing-the-real-numbers">
<h2>21.3. Constructing the Real Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#constructing-the-real-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>The problem we face is that the sequence <span class="math">\(1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, \ldots\)</span> of rational numbers seems to approach a value that <em>would</em> be the square root of 2, but there is no rational number that can play that role. The next definition captures the notion that this sequence of numbers &#8220;seems to approach a value,&#8221; without referring to a value that it is approaching.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A sequence of rational numbers <span class="math">\((q_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> is <em>Cauchy</em> if for every rational number <span class="math">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, there is some natural number <span class="math">\(N \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> such that for all <span class="math">\(i, j \geq N\)</span>, we have that <span class="math">\(|q_i - q_j| &lt; \varepsilon\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Roughly speaking, a Cauchy sequence is one where the elements become arbitrarily close, not just to their successors but to all following elements. It is common in mathematics to use <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> to represent a quantity that is intended to denote something small; you should read the phrase &#8220;for every <span class="math">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>&#8221; as saying &#8220;no matter how small <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is.&#8221; So a sequence is Cauchy if, for any <span class="math">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, no matter how small, there is some point <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, beyond which the elements stay within a distance of <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> of one another.</p>
<p>Cauchy sequences can be used to describe these gaps in the rationals, but, as noted above, many Cauchy sequences can be used to describe the same gap. At this stage, it is slightly misleading to say that they &#8220;approach the same point,&#8221; since there is no rational point that they approach; a more precise statement is that the sequences eventually become arbitrarily close.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Two Cauchy sequences <span class="math">\(p = (p_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q = (q_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> are <em>equivalent</em> if for every rational number <span class="math">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, there is some natural number <span class="math">\(N \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> such that for all <span class="math">\(i \geq N\)</span>, we have that <span class="math">\(|p_i - q_i| &lt; \varepsilon\)</span>. We will write <span class="math">\(p \equiv q\)</span> to express that <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> is an equivalence relation on Cauchy sequences.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Reflexivity and symmetry are easy, so let us prove transitivity. Suppose <span class="math">\((p_i) \equiv (q_i)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((q_i) \equiv (r_i)\)</span>. We want to show that the sequence <span class="math">\((q_i)\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math">\((r_i)\)</span>. So, given any <span class="math">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, choose <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> large enough such that for every <span class="math">\(i \ge N_0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(|p_i - q_i| &lt; \varepsilon / 2\)</span>. Choose another number, <span class="math">\(N_1\)</span>, so that for every <span class="math">\(i \geq N_1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(|q_i - r_i| &lt; \varepsilon / 2\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(N = \max(N_0, N_1)\)</span>. Then for every <span class="math">\(i \geq N\)</span>, we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[|p_i - r_i | = |(p_i - q_i) + (q_i - r_i)| &lt; |p_i - q_i| + |q_i - r_i| \leq \varepsilon / 2 + \varepsilon / 2 = \varepsilon,\]</div>
<p>as required.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Notice that the proof uses the <em>triangle inequality</em>, which states for any rational numbers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\)</span>. If we define <span class="math">\(|a|\)</span> to be the maximum of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(-a\)</span>, the triangle inequality in fact holds for any ordered ring:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> be elements of any ordered ring. Then <span class="math">\(|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> By the definition of absolute value, it suffices to show that <span class="math">\(a + b \leq |a| + |b|\)</span> and <span class="math">\(-(a + b) \leq |a| + |b|\)</span>. The first claim follows from the fact that <span class="math">\(a \leq |a|\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \leq |b|\)</span>. For the second claim, we similarly have <span class="math">\(-a \leq |a|\)</span> and <span class="math">\(-b \leq |b|\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(-(a + b) = -a + - b \leq |a| + |b|\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In the theorem above, if we let <span class="math">\(a = x - y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b = y - z\)</span>, we get <span class="math">\(|x - z| \leq |x - y| + |y - z|\)</span>. The fact that <span class="math">\(|x - y|\)</span> represents the distance between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> on the number line explains the name: for any three &#8220;points&#8221; <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, the distance from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(z\)</span> can&#8217;t be any greater than the distance from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(y\)</span> plus the distance from <span class="math">\(y\)</span> to <span class="math">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> be the set of Cauchy sequences of rationals, and define the real numbers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, to be <span class="math">\(A / \mathord{\equiv}\)</span>. In other words, the real numbers are the set of Cauchy sequence of rationals, modulo the equivalence relation we just defined.</p>
<p>Having the set <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> by itself is not enough: we also would like to know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers. As with the integers, we need to define operations on the underlying set, and then show that they respect the equivalence relation. For example, we will say how to add Cauchy sequences of rationals, and then show that if <span class="math">\(p_1 \equiv p_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q_1 \equiv q_2\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(p_1 + q_1 \equiv p_2 + q_2\)</span>. We can then lift this definition to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> by defining <span class="math">\([p] + [q]\)</span> to be <span class="math">\([p + q]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Luckily, it is easy to define addition, subtraction, and multiplication on Cauchy sequences. If <span class="math">\(p = (p_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q = (q_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> are Cauchy sequences, let <span class="math">\(p + q = (p_i + q_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span>, and similarly for subtraction and multiplication. It is trickier to show that these sequences are Cauchy themselves, and to show that the operations have the appropriate algebraic properties. We ask you to prove some of these properties in the exercises.</p>
<p>We can identify each rational number <span class="math">\(q\)</span> with the constant Cauchy sequence <span class="math">\(q, q, q, \ldots\)</span>, so the real numbers include all the rationals. The next step is to abstract away the details of the particular construction we have chosen, so that henceforth we can work with the real numbers abstractly, and no longer think of them as given by equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rationals.</p>

<h2>21.4. The Completeness of the Real Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#the-completeness-of-the-real-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>We constructed the real numbers to fill in the gaps in the rationals. How do we know that we have got them all? Perhaps we need to construct even more numbers, using Cauchy sequences of reals? The next theorem tells us that, on the contrary, there is no need to extend the reals any further in this way.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(r\)</span> be a real number. A sequence <span class="math">\((r_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> of real numbers <em>converges</em> to <span class="math">\(r\)</span> if, for every <span class="math">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, there is an <span class="math">\(N\)</span> such that for every <span class="math">\(i \geq N\)</span>, <span class="math">\(|r_i - r| &lt; \varepsilon\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A sequence <span class="math">\((r_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> <em>converges</em> if it converges to some <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The statement of the theorem is often expressed by saying that the real numbers are <em>complete</em>. Roughly, it says that everywhere you look for a real number, you are bound to find one. Here is a similar principle.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> An element <span class="math">\(u \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> is said to be an <em>upper bound</em> to a subset <span class="math">\(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span> if everything in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is less than or equal to <span class="math">\(u\)</span>. <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is said to be <em>bounded</em> if there is an upper bound to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. An element <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is said to be a <em>least upper bound</em> to <span class="math">\(S\)</span> if it is an upper bound to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, and nothing smaller than <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is an upper bound to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(S\)</span> be a bounded, nonempty subset of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(S\)</span> has a least upper bound.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The rational numbers do not have this property: if we set <span class="math">\(S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid x^2 &lt; 2\}\)</span>, then the rational number 2 is an upper bound for <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, but <span class="math">\(S\)</span> has no least upper bound in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental theorem that the real numbers are characterized exactly by the property that they are a complete ordered field, such that every real number <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is less than or equal to some natural number <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. Any two models that meet these requirements must behave in exactly the same way, at least insofar as the constants <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, the operations <span class="math">\(+\)</span> and <span class="math">\(*\)</span>, and the relation <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> are concerned. This fact is extremely powerful because it allows us to avoid thinking about the Cauchy sequence construction in normal mathematics. Once we have shown that our construction meets these requirements, we can take <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> to be &#8220;the&#8221; unique complete totally ordered field and ignore any implementation details. We are also free to implement <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> in any way we choose, and as long as it meets this interface, and as long as they do not refer to the underlying representations, any theorems we prove about the reals will hold equally well for all constructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-alternative-construction">
<h2>21.5. An Alternative Construction<a class="headerlink" href="#an-alternative-construction" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Many sources use an alternative construction of the reals, taking them instead to be <em>Dedekind cuts</em>. A Dedekind cut is an ordered pair <span class="math">\((A, B)\)</span> of sets of rational numbers with the following properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Every rational number <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is in either <span class="math">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</li>
<li>Each <span class="math">\(a \in A\)</span> is less than every <span class="math">\(b \in B\)</span>.</li>
<li>There is no greatest element of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are both nonempty.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two properties show why we call this pair a &#8220;cut.&#8221; The set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> contains all of the rational numbers to the left of some mark on the number line, and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> all of the points to the right. The third property tells us something about what happens exactly at that mark. But there are two possibilities: either <span class="math">\(B\)</span> has a least element, or it doesn&#8217;t. Picturing the situation where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has no greatest element and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> has no least element may be tricky, but consider the example <span class="math">\(A = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid x^2 &lt; 2\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid x^2 &gt; 2\}\)</span>. There is no rational number <span class="math">\(q\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(q^2 = 2\)</span>, but there are rational numbers on either side that are arbitrarily close; thus neither <span class="math">\(A\)</span> nor <span class="math">\(B\)</span> contains an endpoint.</p>
<p>We can define <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> to be the set of Dedekind cuts. A Dedekind cut <span class="math">\((A, B)\)</span> corresponds to a rational number <span class="math">\(q\)</span> if <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the least element of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and to an irrational number if <span class="math">\(B\)</span> has no least element. It is straightforward to define addition on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[(A_1, B_1) + (A_2, B_2) = ( \{a_1 + a_2 \mid a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2 \}, \{b_1 + b_2 \mid b_1 \in B_1, b_2 \in B_2 \} ).\]</div>
<p>Some authors prefer this construction to the Cauchy sequence construction because it avoids taking the quotient of a set, and thus removes the complication of showing that arithmetic operations respect equivalence. Others prefer Cauchy sequences since they provide a clearer notion of approximation: if a real number <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is given by a Cauchy sequence <span class="math">\((q_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span>, then an arbitrarily close rational approximation of <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is given by <span class="math">\(q_N\)</span> for a sufficiently large <span class="math">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>For most mathematicians most of the time, though, the difference is immaterial. Both constructions create complete linear ordered fields, and in a certain sense, they create the <em>same</em> complete linear ordered field. Strictly speaking, the set of Cauchy reals is not equal to the set of Dedekind reals, since one consists of equivalence classes of rational Cauchy sequences and one consists of pairs of sets of rationals. But there is a bijection between the two sets that preserves the field properties. That is, there is a bijection <span class="math">\(f\)</span> from the Cauchy reals to the Dedekind reals such that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(f(0)=0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(1)=1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x \cdot y)=f(x) \cdot f(y)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(-x)=-f(x)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x^{-1})=f(x)^{-1}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x) \leq f(y) \iff x \leq y\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We say that the two constructions are <em>isomorphic</em>, and that the function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is an <em>isomorphism</em>. Since we often only care about the real numbers in regard to their status as a complete ordered field, and the two constructions are indistinguishable as ordered fields, it makes no difference which construction is used.</p>
