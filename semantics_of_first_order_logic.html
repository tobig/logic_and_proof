<span id="id1"></span><h1>10. Semantics of First Order Logic<a class="headerlink" href="#semantics-of-first-order-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h1>
<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="semantics_of_propositional_logic.html#semantics-of-propositional-logic"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 6</span></a>, we emphasized a distinction between the <em>syntax</em> and the <em>semantics</em> of propositional logic. Syntactic questions have to do with the formal structure of formulas and the conditions under which different types of formulas can be derived. Semantic questions, on the other hand, concern the <em>truth</em> of a formula relative to some truth assignment.</p>
<p>As you might expect, we can make a similar distinction in the setting of first order logic. The previous two chapters have focused on syntax, but some semantic ideas have slipped in. Recall the running example with domain of interest <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, constant symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, function symbols <span class="math">\(\mathit{add}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathit{mul}\)</span>, and predicate symbols <span class="math">\(\mathit{even}, \mathit{prime}, \mathit{equals}, \mathit{le}\)</span>, etc. We know that the sentence <span class="math">\(\forall y \; \mathit{le}(0, y)\)</span> is true in this example, if <span class="math">\(\mathit{le}\)</span> is interpreted as the less-than-or-equal-to relation on the natural numbers. But if we consider the domain <span class="math">\({\mathbb Z}\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, that same formula becomes false. The sentence <span class="math">\(\forall y \; \mathit{lt}(0,y)\)</span> is also false if we consider the domain <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, but (somewhat perversely) interpret the predicate <span class="math">\(\mathit{lt}(x, y)\)</span> as the relation &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> is greater than <span class="math">\(y\)</span>&#8221; on the natural numbers.</p>
<p>This indicates that the truth or falsity or a first order sentence can depend on how we interpret the quantifiers and basic relations of the language. But some formulas are true under any interpretation: for instance, <span class="math">\(\forall y \; (\mathit{le}(0, y) \to \mathit{le}(0, y))\)</span> is true under all the interpretations considered in the last paragraph, and, indeed, under any interpretation we choose. A sentence like this is said to be <em>valid</em>; this is the analogue of a tautology in propositional logic, which is true under every possible truth assignment.</p>
<p>We can broaden the analogy: a &#8220;model&#8221; in first order logic is the analogue of a truth assignment in propositional logic. In the propositional case, choosing a truth assignment allowed us to assign truth values to all formulas of the language; now, choosing a model will allow us to assign truth values to all sentences of a first order language. The aim of the next section is to make this notion more precise.</p>
<div class="section" id="interpretations">
<h2>10.1. Interpretations<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretations" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>The symbols of the language in our running example&#8212;0, 1, <span class="math">\(\mathit{add}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}\)</span>, and so on&#8212;have very suggestive names. When we interpret sentences of this language over the domain <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, for example, it is clear for which elements of the domain <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}\)</span> &#8220;should&#8221; be true, and for which it &#8220;should&#8221; be false. But let us consider a first order language that has only two unary predicate symbols <span class="math">\(\mathit{fancy}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathit{tall}\)</span>. If we take our domain to be <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, is the sentence <span class="math">\(\forall x \; (\mathit{fancy}(x) \to \mathit{tall}(x))\)</span> true or false?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that we don&#8217;t have enough information to say. There&#8217;s no obvious meaning to the predicates <span class="math">\(\mathit{fancy}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\mathit{tall}\)</span>, at least not when we apply them to natural numbers. To make sense of the sentence, we need to know which numbers are fancy and which ones are tall. Perhaps multiples of 10 are fancy, and even numbers are tall; in this case, the formula is true, since every multiple of 10 is even. Perhaps prime numbers are fancy and odd numbers are tall; then the formula is false, since 2 is fancy but not tall.</p>
<p>We call each of these descriptions an <em>interpretation</em> of the predicate symbols <span class="math">\(\mathit{fancy}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathit{tall}\)</span> in the domain <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>. Formally, an interpretation of a unary predicate <span class="math">\(P\)</span> in a domain <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is the set of elements of <span class="math">\(D\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is true. For an example, the standard interpretation of <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}\)</span> in <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span> that we used above was just the set of prime natural numbers.</p>
<p>We can interpret constant, function, and relation symbols in a similar way. An interpretation of constant symbol <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in domain <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is an element of <span class="math">\(D\)</span>. An interpretation of a function symbol <span class="math">\(f\)</span> with arity <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is a function that maps <span class="math">\(n\)</span> elements of <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to another element of <span class="math">\(D\)</span>. An interpretation of a relation symbol <span class="math">\(R\)</span> with arity <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> tuples of elements of <span class="math">\(D\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is true.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize the difference between a syntactic predicate symbol (or function symbol, or constant symbol) and the semantic predicate (or function, or object) to which it is interpreted. The former is a symbol, relates to other symbols, and has no meaning on its own until we specify an interpretation. Strictly speaking, it makes no sense to write <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}(3)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}\)</span> is a predicate symbol and 3 is a natural number, since the argument to <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}\)</span> is supposed to be a syntactic term. Sometimes we may obscure this distinction, as above when we specified a language with constant symbols 0, 1, and 2. But there is still a fundamental distinction between the objects of the domain and the symbols we use to represent them.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we interpret a language in a particular domain, it is useful to implicitly introduce new constant symbols into the language to denote elements of this domain. Specifically, for each element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> of the domain, we introduce a constant symbol <span class="math">\(\bar a\)</span>, which is interpreted as <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Then the expression <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}(\bar 3)\)</span> does make sense. Interpreting the predicate symbol <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}\)</span> in the natural way, this expression will evaluate to true. We think of <span class="math">\(\bar 3\)</span> as a linguistic &#8220;name&#8221; that represents the natural number 3, in the same way that the phrase &#8220;Aristotle&#8221; is a name that represents the ancient Greek philosopher.</p>

<div class="section" id="truth-in-a-model">
<h2>10.2. Truth in a Model<a class="headerlink" href="#truth-in-a-model" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Fix a first-order language. Suppose we have chosen a domain <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to interpret the language, along with an interpretation in <span class="math">\(D\)</span> of each of the symbols of that language. We will call this structure&#8212;the domain <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, paired with the interpretation&#8212;a <em>model</em> for the language. A model for a first-order language is directly analogous to a truth assignment for propositional logic, because it provides all the information we need to determine the truth value of each sentence in the language.</p>
<p>The procedure for evaluating the truth of a sentence based on a model works the way you think it should, but the formal description is subtle. Recall the difference between <em>terms</em> and <em>assertions</em> that we made earlier in Chapter 4. Terms, like <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x + y\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(f(c)\)</span>, are meant to represent objects. A term does not have a truth value, since (for example) it makes no sense to ask whether 3 is true or false. Assertions, like <span class="math">\(P(a)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(R(x, f(y))\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(a + b &gt; a \wedge \mathit{prime}(c)\)</span>, apply predicate or relation symbols to terms to produce statements that could be true or false.</p>
<p>The interpretation of a term in a model is an element of the domain of that model. The model directly specifies how to interpret constant symbols. To interpret a term <span class="math">\(f(t)\)</span> created by applying a function symbol to another term, we interpret the term <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, and then apply the interpretation of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to this term. (This process makes sense, since the interpretation of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a function on the domain.) This generalizes to functions of higher arity in the obvious way. We will not yet interpret terms that include free variables like <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, since these terms do not pick out unique elements of the domain. (The variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span> could potentially refer to any object.)</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a language with two constant symbols, <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, a unary function symbol <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, and a binary function symbol <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> be the model with domain <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are interpreted as <span class="math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, respectively, <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is interpreted as the function which maps any natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> to <span class="math">\(n^2\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is the addition function. Then the term <span class="math">\(g(f(a),b)\)</span> denotes the natural number <span class="math">\(3^2+5 = 14\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the interpretation of an assertion is a value <span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span>. For the sake of brevity, we will introduce new notation here: if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is an assertion and <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> is a model of the language of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, we write <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A\)</span> to mean that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> evaluates to <span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span> in <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \not\models A\)</span> to mean that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> evaluates to <span class="math">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span>. (You can read the symbol <span class="math">\(\models\)</span> as &#8220;satisfies&#8221; or &#8220;validates.&#8221;)</p>
<p>To interpret a predicate or relation applied to some terms, we first interpret those terms, and then see if the interpretation of the relation symbol is true of those objects. To continue with the example, suppose our language also has a relation symbol <span class="math">\(\mathit{R}\)</span>, and we extend <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> to interpret <span class="math">\(R\)</span> as the greater-than-or-equal-to relation. Then we have <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \not \models R(a, b)\)</span>, since 3 is not greater than 5, but <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models R(g(f(a),b),b)\)</span>, since 14 is greater than 5.</p>
<p>Interpreting expressions using the logical connectives <span class="math">\(\wedge\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\vee\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\to\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\neg\)</span> works exactly as it did in the propositional setting. <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A \wedge B\)</span> exactly when <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A\)</span> and <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models B\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>We still need to explain how to interpret existential and universal expressions. We saw that <span class="math">\(\exists x \; A\)</span> intuitively meant that there was <em>some</em> element of the domain that would make <span class="math">\(A\)</span> true, when we &#8220;replaced&#8221; the variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span> with that element. To make this a bit more precise, we say that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \exists x A\)</span> exactly when there is an element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in the domain of <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> such that, when we interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, then <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A\)</span>. To continue the example above, we have <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \exists x \; (R(x, b))\)</span>, since when we interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as 6 we have <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models R(x, b)\)</span>.</p>
<p>More concisely, we can say that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \exists x \; A\)</span> when there is an <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in the domain of <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A[\bar a / x]\)</span>. The notation <span class="math">\(A[\bar a / x]\)</span> indicates that every occurrence of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has been replaced by the symbol <span class="math">\(\bar a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that <span class="math">\(\forall x \; A\)</span> meant that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> was true for all possible values of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. We make this precise by saying that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \forall x \; A\)</span> exactly when for every element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in the domain of <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span>, interpreting <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as <span class="math">\(a\)</span> gives that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A\)</span>. Alternatively, we can say that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \forall x \; A\)</span> when for every <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in the domain of <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A[\bar a / x]\)</span>. In our example above, <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \not\models \forall x \; (R(x, b))\)</span>, since when we interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as 2 we do not have <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models R(x, b)\)</span>.</p>
<p>These rules allow us to determine the truth value of any <em>sentence</em> in a model. (Remember, a sentence is a formula with no free variables.) There are some subtleties: for instance, we&#8217;ve implicitly assumed that our formula doesn&#8217;t quantify over the same variable twice, as in <span class="math">\(\forall x \; \exists x \; A\)</span>. But for the most part, the interpretation process tells us to &#8220;read&#8221; a formula as talking directly about objects in the domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>10.3. Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Take a simple language with no constant symbols, one relation symbol <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>, and one binary function symbol <span class="math">\(+\)</span>. Our model <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> will have domain <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, and the symbols will be interpreted as the standard less-than-or-equal-to relation and addition function.</p>
<p>Think about the following questions before you read the answers below. Remember, our domain is <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, not <span class="math">\({\mathbb Z}\)</span> or any other number system.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Is it true that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \exists x \; (x \leq x)\)</span>? What about <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \forall x \; (x \leq x)\)</span>?</li>
<li>Similarly, what about <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \exists x \; (x + x \leq x)\)</span>? <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \forall x \; (x + x \leq x)\)</span>?</li>
<li>Do the sentences <span class="math">\(\exists x \; \forall y \; (x \leq y)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\forall x \; \exists y \; (x \leq y)\)</span> mean the same thing? Are they true or false?</li>
<li>Can you think of a formula <span class="math">\(A\)</span> in this language, with one free variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \forall x \; A\)</span> but <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \not \models \exists x \; A\)</span>?</li>
</ol>
<p>These questions indicate a subtle, and often tricky, interplay between the universal and existential quantifiers. Once you&#8217;ve thought about them a bit, read the answers:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Both of these statements are true. For the former, we can (for example) interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as the natural number 0. Then, <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models x \leq x\)</span>, so the existential is true. For the latter, pick an arbitrary natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>; it is still the case that when we interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models x \leq x\)</span>.</li>
<li>The first statement is true, since we can interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as 0. The second statement, though, is false. When we interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as 1 (or, in fact, as any natural number besides 0), we see that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \not \models x + x \leq x\)</span>.</li>
<li>These sentences do <em>not</em> mean the same thing, although in the specified model, both are true. The first expresses that some natural number is less than or equal to every natural number. This is true: 0 is less than or equal to every natural number. The second sentence says that for every natural number, there is another natural number at least as big. Again, this is true: every natural number <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is less than or equal to <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. If we took our domain to be <span class="math">\({\mathbb Z}\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>, the first sentence would be false, while the second would still be true.</li>
<li>The situation described here is impossible in our model. If <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \forall x A\)</span>, then <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models A [\bar 0 / x]\)</span>, which implies that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \exists x A\)</span>. The only time this situation can happen is when the domain of our model is empty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now consider a different language with constant symbol 2, predicate symbols <span class="math">\(\mathit{prime}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathit{odd}\)</span>, and binary relation <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span>, interpreted in the natural way over domain <span class="math">\({\mathbb N}\)</span>. The sentence <span class="math">\(\forall x \; (2 &lt; x \wedge \mathit{prime}(x) \to \mathit{odd}(x))\)</span> expresses the fact that every prime number bigger than 2 is odd. It is an example of <em>relativization</em>, discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="first_order_logic.html#relativization-and-sorts"><span class="std std-numref">Section 7.4</span></a>. We can now see semantically how relativization works. This sentence is true in our model if, for every natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, interpreting <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as <span class="math">\(n\)</span> makes the sentence true. If we interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as 0, 1, or 2, or as any non-prime number, the hypothesis of the implication is false, and thus <span class="math">\(2 &lt; x \wedge \mathit{prime}(x) \to \mathit{odd}(x)\)</span> is true. Otherwise, if we interpret <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as a prime number bigger than 2, both the hypothesis and conclusion of the implication are true, and <span class="math">\(2 &lt; x \wedge \mathit{prime}(x) \to \mathit{odd}(x)\)</span> is again true. Thus the universal statement holds. It was an example like this that partially motivated our semantics for implication back in Chapter 3; any other choice would make relativization impossible.</p>
<p>For the next example, we will consider models that are given by a rectangular grid of &#8220;dots.&#8221; Each dot has a color (red, blue, or green) and a size (small or large). We use the letter <span class="math">\(R\)</span> to represent a large red dot and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> to represent a small red dot, and similarly for <span class="math">\(G, g, B, b\)</span>.</p>
<p>The logical language we use to describe our dot world has predicates <span class="math">\(\mathit{red}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathit{green}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathit{blue}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathit{small}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathit{large}\)</span>, which are interpreted in the obvious ways. The relation <span class="math">\(\mathit{adj}(x, y)\)</span> is true if the dots referred to by <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are touching, not on a diagonal. The relations <span class="math">\(\mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}color}(x, y)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}size}(x, y)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}row}(x, y)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}column}(x, y)\)</span> are also self-explanatory. The relation <span class="math">\(\mathit{left{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}of}(x, y)\)</span> is true if the dot referred to by <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is left of the dot referred to by <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, regardless of what rows the dots are in. The interpretations of <span class="math">\(\mathit{right{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}of}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathit{above}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\mathit{below}\)</span> are similar.</p>
<p>Consider the following sentences:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (\mathit{green}(x) \vee \mathit{blue}(x))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\exists x, y \;  (\mathit{adj}(x, y) \wedge \mathit{green}(x) \wedge \mathit{green}(y))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\exists x \; ((\exists z \; \mathit{right{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}of}(z, x)) \wedge (\forall y \; (\mathit{left{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}of}(x, y) \to \mathit{blue}(y) \vee \mathit{small}(y))))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (\mathit{large}(x) \to \exists y \; (\mathit{small}(y) \wedge \mathit{adj}(x, y)))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; (\mathit{green}(x) \to \exists y \; (\mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}row}(x, y) \wedge \mathit{blue}(y)))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x, y \; (\mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}row}(x, y) \wedge \mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}column}(x, y) \to x = y)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\exists x \; \forall y \; (\mathit{adj}(x, y) \to \neg \mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}size}(x, y))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall x \; \exists y \; (\mathit{adj}(x, y) \wedge \mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}color}(x, y))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\exists y \; \forall x \; (\mathit{adj}(x, y) \wedge \mathit{same{\mathord{\mbox{-}}}color}(x, y))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\exists x \; (\mathit{blue}(x) \wedge \exists y \; (\mathit{green}(y) \wedge \mathit{above}(x, y)))\)</span></li>

<h2>10.4. Validity and Logical Consequence<a class="headerlink" href="#validity-and-logical-consequence" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>We have seen that whether a formula is true or false often depends on the model we choose. Some formulas, though, are true in every possible model. An example we saw earlier was <span class="math">\(\forall y \; (\mathit{le}(0, y) \to \mathit{le}(0, y))\)</span>. Why is this sentence valid? Suppose <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> is an arbitrary model of the language, and suppose <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is an arbitrary element of the domain of <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span>. Either <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \mathit{le}(0, \bar a)\)</span> or <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \neg \mathit{le}(0, \bar a)\)</span>. In either case, the propositional semantics of implication guarantee that <span class="math">\({\mathcal M} \models \mathit{le}(0, \bar a) \to \mathit{le}(0, \bar a)\)</span>. We often write <span class="math">\(\models A\)</span> to mean that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is valid.</p>
<p>In the propositional setting, there is an easy method to figure out if a formula is a tautology or not. Writing the truth table and checking for any rows ending with <span class="math">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span> is algorithmic, and we know from the beginning exactly how large the truth table will be. Unfortunately, we cannot do the same for first-order formulas. Any language has infinitely many models, so a &#8220;first-order&#8221; truth table would be infinitely long. To make matters worse, even checking whether a formula is true in a single model can be a non-algorithmic task. To decide whether a universal statement like <span class="math">\(\forall x \; P(x)\)</span> is true in a model with an infinite domain, we might have to check whether <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is true of infinitely many elements.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we can <em>never</em> figure out if a first-order sentence is a tautology. For example, we have argued that <span class="math">\(\forall y \; (\mathit{lt}(0, y) \to \mathit{lt}(0, y))\)</span> was one. It is just a more difficult question than for propositional logic.</p>
<p>As was the case with propositional logic, we can extend the notion of validity to a notion of logical consequence. Fix a first-order language, <span class="math">\(L\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a set of sentences in <span class="math">\(L\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a sentence of <span class="math">\(L\)</span>. We will say that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> <em>is a logical consequence of</em> <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> if every model of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a model of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. This is one way of spelling out that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a &#8220;necessary consequence&#8221; of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>: under any interpretation, if the hypotheses in <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> come out true, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is true as well.</p>

<div class="section" id="soundness-and-completeness">
<h2>10.5. Soundness and Completeness<a class="headerlink" href="#soundness-and-completeness" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>In propositional logic, we saw a close connection between the provable formulas and the tautologies&#8212;specifically, a formula is provable if and only if it is a tautology. More generally, we say that a formula <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a logical consequence of a set of hypotheses, <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>, if and only if there is a natural deduction proof of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>. It turns out that the analogous statements hold for first order logic.</p>
<p>The &#8220;soundness&#8221; direction&#8212;the fact that if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is provable from <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> then <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is true in any model of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>&#8212;holds for reasons that are similar to the reasons it holds in the propositional case. Specifically, the proof proceeds by showing that each rule of natural deduction preserves the truth in a model.</p>
<p>The completeness theorem for first order logic was first proved by Kurt G&#246;del in his 1929 dissertation. Another, simpler proof was later provided by Leon Henkin.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If a formula <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a logical consequence of a set of sentences <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is provable from <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Compared to the version for propositional logic, the first order completeness theorem is harder to prove. We will not go into too much detail here, but will indicate some of the main ideas. A set of sentences is said to be <em>consistent</em> if you cannot prove a contradiction from those hypotheses. Most of the work in Henkin&#8217;s proof is done by the following &#8220;model existence&#8221; theorem:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Every consistent set of sentences has a model.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>From this theorem, it is easy to deduce the completeness theorem. Suppose there is no proof of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>. Then the set <span class="math">\(\Gamma \cup \{ \neg A \}\)</span> is consistent. (If we could prove <span class="math">\(\bot\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\Gamma \cup \{ \neg A \}\)</span>, then by the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> rule we could prove <span class="math">\(A\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>.) By the model existence theorem, that means that there is a model <span class="math">\({\mathcal M}\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\Gamma \cup \{ \neg A \}\)</span>. But this is a model of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> that is not a model of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is not a logical consequence of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p>The proof of the model existence theorem is intricate. Somehow, from a consistent set of sentences, one has to build a model. The strategy is to build the model out of syntactic entities, in other words, to use terms in an expanded language as the elements of the domain.</p>
<p>The moral here is much the same as it was for propositional logic. Because we have developed our syntactic rules with a certain semantics in mind, the two exhibit different sides of the same coin: the provable sentences are exactly the ones that are true in all models, and the sentences that are provable from a set of hypotheses are exactly the ones that are true in all models of those hypotheses.</p>
<p>We therefore have another way to answer the question posed in the previous section. To show that a sentence is valid, there is no need to check its truth in every possible model. Rather, it suffices to produce a proof.</p>
