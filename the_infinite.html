<h2>22.1. Equinumerosity<a class="headerlink" href="#equinumerosity" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Remember that in <a class="reference internal" href="combinatorics.html#combinatorics"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 20</span></a> we defined, for each natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, the set <span class="math">\([n] = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\)</span>.  We then said that a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is <em>finite</em> if there is a bijection between <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. A set is said to be <em>infinite</em> if it is not finite.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are two finite sets, then they have the same cardinality if and only if there is a bijection between them. It turns out that the same notion of &#8220;having the same cardinality&#8221; makes sense even if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are not finite.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Two sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are said to be <em>equinumerous</em>, written <span class="math">\(A \approx B\)</span>, if there is a bijection between them. Equivalently, we say that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> <em>have the same cardinality</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>At this stage, saying that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> have the same cardinality may sound strange, because it is not clear that there is any object, &#8220;the cardinality of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>,&#8221; that they both &#8220;have.&#8221; It turns out that, in set-theoretic foundations, there are certain objects&#8212;generalizations of the natural numbers&#8212;that one can use to measure the size of an infinite set. There are known as the &#8220;cardinal numbers&#8221; or &#8220;cardinals.&#8221; But they are irrelevant to our purposes here. For the rest of this chapter, when we say that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> have the same cardinality, we mean neither more nor less than the fact that there is a bijection between them.</p>
<p>The following theorem says, essentially, that equinumerosity is an equivalence relation. (The caveat is that so far we have spoke only of relations between sets, and the collection of all sets is not itself a set.)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Proposition</strong>. Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be any sets.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(A \approx A\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(A \approx B\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(B \approx A\)</span>.</li>

<h2>22.2. Countably Infinite Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#countably-infinite-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>The set of natural numbers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, is a prototypical example of an infinite set. To see that it is infinite, suppose, on the other hand, that it is finite. This means that there is a bijection <span class="math">\(f\)</span> between <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> for some natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. We can restrict to the subset <span class="math">\([n+1]\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, and thereby obtain an injective map from <span class="math">\([n+1]\)</span> to <span class="math">\([n]\)</span>. But this violates the pigeonhole principle, proved in <a class="reference internal" href="combinatorics.html#combinatorics"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 20</span></a>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A set is said to be <em>countably infinite</em> if it is equinumerous with <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. A set is said to be <em>countable</em> if it is finite or countably infinite.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Since the identity map <span class="math">\(id(x) = x\)</span> is a bijection on any set, every set is equinumerous with itself, and thus <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> itself is countably infinite.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;countably infinite&#8221; is meant to be evocative. Suppose <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a countable set. By definition, there is a bijection <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to A\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has a &#8220;first&#8221; element <span class="math">\(f(0)\)</span>, a &#8220;second&#8221; element <span class="math">\(f(1)\)</span>, a &#8220;third&#8221; element <span class="math">\(f(2)\)</span>, and so on. Since <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection, for every element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>th element enumerated in this way, for a unique value of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. That is, each element of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is &#8220;counted&#8221; at some finite stage.</p>
<p>With this definition in hand, it is natural to wonder which of our favorite sets are countable. Is the set of integers <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> countable? How about the set of rationals <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, or the set of reals <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>? At this point, you should reflect on the logical form of the statement &#8220;<span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable,&#8221; and think about what is required to show that a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> does or does not have this property.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The set of integers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We need to show that there exists a bijection between <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>. Define <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}f(n) = \begin{cases}
         n / 2 &amp; \mbox{if $n$ is even} \\
         -(n + 1) / 2 &amp; \mbox{if $n$ is odd.}
       \end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>We claim that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection. To see that it is injective, suppose <span class="math">\(f(m) = f(n)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(f(m)\)</span> (and hence also <span class="math">\(f(n)\)</span>) is nonnegative, then <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> are even, in which case <span class="math">\(m / 2 = n / 2\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(m = n\)</span>. Otherwise, <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> are odd, and again <span class="math">\(-(m+1) / 2 = -(n+1)/ 2\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(m = n\)</span>.</p>
<p>To see that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective, suppose <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is any integer. If <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is nonnegative, then <span class="math">\(a = f(2 a)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is strictly negative, then <span class="math">\(2 a - 1\)</span> is also strictly negative, and hence <span class="math">\(-(2 a - 1)\)</span> is an odd natural number. In that case, it is not hard to check that <span class="math">\(a = f(-(2a - 1))\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We will now build up an arsenal of theorems that we can use to show that various sets are countable.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> A set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable if and only if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is empty or there is a surjective function <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to A\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> For the forward direction, suppose <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable. Then it is either finite or countably infinite. If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countably infinite, there is a bijection from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, and we are done. Suppose, then, that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is finite. If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is empty, we are done. Otherwise, for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, there is a bijection <span class="math">\(f : [n] \to A\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(n \geq 1\)</span>. Define a function <span class="math">\(g : \mathbb{N} \to A\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}g(i) = \begin{cases}
         f(i) &amp; \mbox{if $i &lt; n$} \\
         f(0) &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
       \end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In other words, <span class="math">\(g\)</span> enumerates the elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> by using <span class="math">\(f\)</span> first, and then repeating the element <span class="math">\(f(0)\)</span>. Clearly <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective, as required.</p>
<p>In the other direction, if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is finite, then it is countable, and we are done. So suppose <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is not finite. Then it is not empty, and so there is a surjective function <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to A\)</span>. We need to turn <span class="math">\(f\)</span> into a <em>bijective</em> function. The problem is that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> may not be injective, which is to say, elements in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> may be enumerated more than once. The solution is to define a function, <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, which eliminates all the duplicates. The idea is that <span class="math">\(g\)</span> should enumerate the elements <span class="math">\(f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots\)</span>, but skip over the ones that have already been enumerated.</p>
<p>To be precise, the function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is defined recursively as follows: <span class="math">\(g(0) = f(0)\)</span>, and for every <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g(i+1) = f(j)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(j\)</span> is the least natural number such that <span class="math">\(f(j)\)</span> is not among <span class="math">\(\{g(0), g(1), g(2), \ldots, g(i) \}\)</span>. The assumption that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is infinite and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective guarantees that some such <span class="math">\(j\)</span> always exists.</p>
<p>We only need to check that <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is a bijection. By definition, for every <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g(i+1)\)</span> is different from <span class="math">\(g(0), \ldots, g(i)\)</span>. This implies that <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is injective. But we can also show by induction that for every <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\{g(0), \ldots, g(i)\} \supseteq \{ f(0), \ldots, f(i)\}\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective, <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is too.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In a manner similar to the way we proved that the integers are countable, we can prove the following:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are countably infinite, then so is <span class="math">\(A \cup B\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g : \mathbb{N} \to B\)</span> are surjective. Then we can define a function <span class="math">\(h : \mathbb{N} \to A \cup B\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}h(n) = \begin{cases}
         f(n/2) &amp; \mbox{if $n$ is even} \\
         g((n-1)/2) &amp; \mbox{if $n$ is odd.}
       \end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>It is not hard to show that <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is surjective.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Intuitively, if <span class="math">\(A = \{ f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots \}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B = \{ g(0), g(1), g(2), \ldots\}\)</span>, then we can enumerate <span class="math">\(A \cup B\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\{ f(0), g(0), f(1), g(1), f(2), g(2), \ldots \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The next two theorems are also helpful. The first says that to show that a set <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is countable, it is enough to &#8220;cover&#8221; it with a surjective function from a countable set. The second says that to show that a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable, then it is enough to embed it in a countable set.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable and <span class="math">\(f : A \to B\)</span> is surjective, then <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable, then there is a surjective function <span class="math">\(g : \mathbb{N} \to A\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(f \circ g\)</span> is a surjective function from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \to B\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is countable and <span class="math">\(f : A \to B\)</span> is injective, then <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Assuming <span class="math">\(f : A \to B\)</span> is injective, it has a left inverse, <span class="math">\(g : B \to A\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(g\)</span> has a right inverse, <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, we know that <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is surjective, and we can apply the previous theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary.</strong> If <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is countable and <span class="math">\(A \subseteq B\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> The function <span class="math">\(f : A \to B\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\(f(x) = x\)</span> is injective.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Remember that <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span> is the set of ordered pairs <span class="math">\((i, j)\)</span> where <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span> are natural numbers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Enumerate the elements as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\[(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), \ldots\]</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If you think of the pairs as coordinates in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-<span class="math">\(y\)</span> plane, the pairs are enumerated along diagonals: first the diagonal with pairs whose elements sum to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, then the diagonal with pairs whose elements sum to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and so on. This is often called a &#8220;dovetailing&#8221; argument, because if you imagine drawing a line that weaves back and forth through the pairs enumerated this ways, it will be analogous to the a carpenter&#8217;s practice of using a dovetail to join two pieces of wood. (And that term, in turn, comes from the similarity to a dove&#8217;s tail.)</p>
<p>As far as proofs go, the informal description above and the associated diagram are perfectly compelling. It is possible to describe a bijection between <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span> explicitly, however, in algebraic terms. You are asked to do this in the exercises.</p>
<p>The previous theorem has a number of interesting consequences.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are countable, then so is <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> If <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is any element of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span>, write <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p_1\)</span> to denote the two components. Let <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span> be a surjection, as guaranteed by the previous theorem. Suppose <span class="math">\(g : \mathbb{N} \to A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h : \mathbb{N} \to B\)</span> be surjective. Then the function <span class="math">\(k(i) = ( g(f(i)_0), h(f(i)_1) )\)</span> is a surjective function from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The set of rational numbers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> By the previous theorem, we know that <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}\)</span> is countable. Define <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}\)</span> by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}f(i,j) = \begin{cases}
           i / j &amp; \mbox{if $j \neq 0$} \\
           0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
         \end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Since every element of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> can be written as <span class="math">\(i / j\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable. For each <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, the set <span class="math">\(A^n\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Remember that we can identify the set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-tuples of elements from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> with <span class="math">\(A \times \ldots \times A\)</span>, where there are <span class="math">\(n\)</span> copies of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> in the product. The result follows using induction on <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math">\((A_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> be a family of sets indexed by the natural numbers, and suppose that each <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span> is countable. Then <span class="math">\(\bigcup_i A_i\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose for each <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f_i\)</span> is a surjective function from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span>. Then the function <span class="math">\(g(i, j) = f_i(j)\)</span> is a surjective function from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\bigcup_i A_i\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable. Then the set of finite sequences of elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> The set of finite sequences of elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is equal to <span class="math">\(\bigcup_i A^i\)</span>, and we can apply the previous two theorems.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Notice that the set of all alphanumeric characters and punctuation (say, represented as the set of all ASCII characters) is finite. Together with the last theorem, this implies that there are only countably many sentences in the English language (and, indeed, any language in which sentences are represented by finite sequences of symbols, chosen from any countable stock).</p>
<p>At this stage, it might seem as though everything is countable. In the next section, we will see that this is not the case: the set of real numbers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, is not countable, and if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is any set (finite or infinite), the powerset of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\({\mathcal P}(A)\)</span>, is not equinumerous with <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>

<div class="section" id="cantor-s-theorem">
<h2>22.3. Cantor&#8217;s Theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#cantor-s-theorem" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>A set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is <em>uncountable</em> if it is not countable. Our goal is to prove the following theorem, due to Georg Cantor.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The set of real numbers is uncountable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Remember that <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span> denotes the closed interval <span class="math">\(\{ r \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \leq r \leq 1\}\)</span>. It suffices to show that there is no surjective function <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to [0,1]\)</span>, since if <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> were countable, <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span> would be countable too.</p>
<p>Recall that every real number <span class="math">\(r \in [0,1]\)</span> has a decimal expansion of the form <span class="math">\(r = 0.r_0 r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 \ldots\)</span>, where each <span class="math">\(r_i\)</span> is a digit in <span class="math">\(\{0, 1, \ldots, 9\}\)</span>. More formally, we can write <span class="math">\(r = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \frac{r_i}{10^{i}}\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(r \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> with <span class="math">\(0 \leq r \leq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Notice that <span class="math">\(1\)</span> can be written <span class="math">\(0.9999\ldots\)</span>. In general every other rational number in <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span> will have two representations of this form; for example, <span class="math">\(0.5 = 0.5000\ldots = 0.49999\ldots\)</span>. For concreteness, for these numbers we can choose the representation that ends with zeros.)</p>
<p>As a result, we can write</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(f(0) = 0.r^0_0 r^0_1 r^0_2 r^0_3 r^0_4 \ldots\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(1) = 0.r^1_0 r^1_1 r^1_2 r^1_3 r^1_4 \ldots\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(2) = 0.r^2_0 r^2_1 r^2_2 r^2_3 r^2_4 \ldots\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(3) = 0.r^3_0 r^3_1 r^3_2 r^3_3 r^3_4 \ldots\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(4) = 0.r^4_0 r^4_1 r^4_2 r^4_3 r^4_4 \ldots\)</span></li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>(We use superscripts, <span class="math">\(r^i\)</span>, to denote the digits of <span class="math">\(f(i)\)</span>. The superscripts do not mean the &#8220;<span class="math">\(i\)</span>th power.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Our goal is to show that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not surjective. To that end, define a new sequence of digits <span class="math">\((r_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}r_i = \begin{cases}
        7 &amp; \mbox{if $r^i_i \neq 7$} \\
        3 &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
      \end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The define the real number <span class="math">\(r = 0.r_0 r_1 r_2 r_3 \ldots\)</span>. Then, for each <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(r\)</span> differs from <span class="math">\(f(i)\)</span> in the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th digit. But this means that for every <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f(i) \neq r\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is not in the range of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, we see that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not surjective. Since <span class="math">\(f\)</span> was arbitrary, there is no surjective function from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span>.</p>
<p>(We chose the digits <span class="math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(7\)</span> only to avoid <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(9\)</span>, to avoid the case where, for example, <span class="math">\(f(0) = 0.5000\ldots\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r = 0.4999\ldots\)</span>. Since there are no zeros or nines in <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, since the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th digit of <span class="math">\(r\)</span> differs from <span class="math">\(f(i)\)</span>, it really is a different real number.)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This remarkable proof is known as a &#8220;diagonalization argument.&#8221; We are trying to construct a real number with a certain property, namely, that it is not in the range of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. We make a table of digits, in which the rows represent infinitely many constraints we have to satisfy (namely, that for each <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f(i) \neq r\)</span>), and the columns represent opportunities to satisfy that constraint (namely, by choosing the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th digit of <span class="math">\(r\)</span> appropriately). Then we complete the construction by stepping along the diagonal, using the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th opportunity to satisfy the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th constraint. This technique is used often in logic and computability theory.</p>
<p>The following provides another example of an uncountable set.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The power set of the natural numbers, <span class="math">\({\mathcal P}(\mathbb{N})\)</span>, is uncountable.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math">\(f : \mathbb{N} \to {\mathcal P}(\mathbb{N})\)</span> be any function. Once again, our goal is to show that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not surjective. Let <span class="math">\(S\)</span> be the set of natural numbers, defined as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\[S = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \notin f(n) \}.\]</div>
<p>In words, for every natural number, <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> if and only if it is not in <span class="math">\(f(n)\)</span>. Then clearly for every <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f(n) \neq S\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not surjective.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We can also view this as a diagonalization argument: draw a table with rows and columns indexed by the natural numbers, where the entry in the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th row and <span class="math">\(j\)</span>th column is &#8220;yes&#8221; if <span class="math">\(j\)</span> is an element of <span class="math">\(f(i)\)</span>, and &#8220;no&#8221; otherwise. The set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is constructed by switching &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; entries along the diagonal.</p>
<p>In fact, exactly the same argument yields the following:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> For every set <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, there is no surjective function from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\({\mathcal P}(A)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> As above, if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is any function from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\({\mathcal P}(A)\)</span>, the set <span class="math">\(S = \{ a \in A \mid a \notin f(a) \}\)</span> is not in the range of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This shows that there is an endless hierarchy of infinities. For example, in the sequence <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}, {\mathcal P}(\mathbb{N}), {\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\mathbb{N})), \ldots\)</span>, there is an injective function mapping each set into the next, but no surjective function. The union of all those sets is even larger still, and then we can take the power set of <em>that</em>, and so on. Set theorists are still today investigating the structure within this hierarchy.</p>

<h2>22.4. An Alternative Definition of Finiteness<a class="headerlink" href="#an-alternative-definition-of-finiteness" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>One thing that distinguishes the infinite from the finite is that an infinite set can have the same size as a proper subset of itself. For example, the natural numbers, the set of even numbers, and the set of perfect squares are all equinumerous, even though the latter two are strictly contained among the natural numbers.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the mathematician Richard Dedekind used this curious property to <em>define</em> what it means to be finite. We can show that his definition is equivalent to ours, but the proof requires the axiom of choice.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A set is <span class="math">\(A\)</span> <em>Dedekind infinite</em> if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is equinumerous with a proper subset of itself, and <em>Dedekind finite</em> otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> A set is Dedekind infinite if and only it is infinite.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is Dedekind infinite. We need to show it is not finite; suppose, to the contrary, it is bijective with <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Composing bijections, we have that <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> is bijective with a proper subset of itself. This means that there is an injective function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> from <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> to a proper subset of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Modifying <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, we can get an injective function from <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> into <span class="math">\([n-1]\)</span>, contradicting the pigeonhole principle.</p>
<p>Suppose, on the other hand, that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is infinite. We need to show that there is an injective function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to a proper subset of itself (because then <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection between <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and the range of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>). Choose a sequence of distinct element <span class="math">\(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots\)</span> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(f\)</span> map each <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> to <span class="math">\(a_{i+1}\)</span>, but leave every other element of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> fixed. Then <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is injective, but <span class="math">\(a_0\)</span> is not in the range of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, as required.</p>

<span id="id1"></span><h2>22.5. The Cantor-Bernstein Theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cantor-bernstein-theorem" title="Permalink to this headline">&#182;</a></h2>
<p>Saying that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are equinumerous means, intuitively, that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> have the same size. There is also a natural way of saying that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is not larger than <span class="math">\(B\)</span>:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> For two sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, we say the cardinality of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is less than or equal to the cardinality of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, written <span class="math">\(A \preceq B\)</span>, when there is an injection <span class="math">\(f : A \to B\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>As an exercise, we ask you to show that <span class="math">\(\preceq\)</span> is a <em>preorder</em>, which is to say, it is reflexive and transitive. Here is a natural question: does <span class="math">\(A \preceq B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B \preceq A\)</span> imply <span class="math">\(A \approx B\)</span>? In other words, assuming there are injective functions <span class="math">\(f : A \to B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g : B \to A\)</span>, is there necessarily a bijection from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span>?</p>
<p>The answer is &#8220;yes,&#8221; but the proof is tricky. The result is known as the <em>Cantor-Bernstein Theorem</em>, and we state it without proof.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> For any sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(A \preceq B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B \preceq A\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(A \approx B\)</span>.</p>
